# Permanent DoS in `SedaCoreV1` via Malicious Contract Requests

### Summary

A malicious actor can create a permanent Denial of Service(DoS) condition in `SedaCoreV1` contract. This can be done by creating a malicious contract that calls `postRequest` and creates cheap(1 wei) requests with large parameters. Also the attacker can make the malicious contract revert on receive msg.value This will prevents the cleanup of these requests by using `withdrawTimedOutRequest` or `postResult` making these requests locked in the contract forever, and making `getPendingRequest` to get OOG error cause of expensive loop iteration.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from three core design flaws in the `SedaCoreV1` contract:

1. No restrictions on request creation with postRequest: The contract allows any address, including malicious contracts, to create requests with arbitrarily large parameters for minimal cost (1 wei for revert case when calling `_transferFee` to the malicious contract). There are no limits on:
   - The size of `execInputs` and `tallyInputs`
   - The number of requests a single address can create
   - Total pending requests in the system

2. Single-transaction cleanup mechanism: The `withdrawTimedOutRequest` function combines state cleanup with ETH transfers in a single atomic transaction. If the ETH transfer fails (which can be deliberately caused by a malicious contract that reverts on receive), the entire transaction reverts, preventing cleanup of malicious requests.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L231

3. Unbounded iteration in `getPendingRequests`: The function must iterate through and process all pending requests to return results, even when using offset and limit parameters. With enough large requests in the system, this function will inevitably run out of gas regardless of the limit parameter.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious contract creating 58 requests with large parameters
2. Malicious contract reverting on `receive` function
3. `getPendingRequests` function failing due to out-of-gas
4. `withdrawTimedOutRequest` function failing to clean up requests cause revert on receive `msg.value`
5. Same as 4 for `postResult` function
6. DoS condition forever

### Impact

This is a High severity since this attack creates a permanent DoS condition that:

1. Makes `getPendingRequests` function permanently unusable, breaking any protocol operations that depend on it. Even with having offset and limit parameters, the function will be unusable
2. Prevents cleanup of malicious requests even after timeout period by using `withdrawTimedOutRequest` or `postResult` with a valid proof.

### PoC

For demostrating this i just created a foundry test that shows the DoS correctly and the amount of gas spent by the attacker:

```

In this test is demonstrated that an attacker can create a malicious contract that creates 58 request making the contract unusable after it.

### Mitigation

For mitigating this i recommend to focus on 2 different problems:

1. Avoiding external contract creating requests: in `postRequest` function, contracts should not be able to create request, in this way we avoid passing a malicious contract that creates unwithdrawable requests.
    1. If calling from a contract is expected, a 2 step mechanims can be added for withdrawing these fees, by pushing all the rewards to a mapping like `mapping(address => uint256) public pendingRefunds;`
    2. Withdraw these funds by using a claim function. This will make the delete and claiming process in two different steps so if a contract has a revert on receive msg.value, a user/admin will be able to delete this request no matter if it cannot receive ETH.
2. Limiting input sizes: Since there’s no limitation on the size of inputs when creating a requests in `postRequest`, an attacker can create really heavy and extensively gas consuming input for almost free, making those function more expensive everytime.
3. Adding a limit for amount of Requests: adding this bound will avoid to have too many requests going one, that can lead into DoS for the protocol. Better to have this parameter limited so also open requests can be tracked properly.
