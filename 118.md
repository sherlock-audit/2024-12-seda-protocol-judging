# Duplicate Validator Signatures

## Summary
The Secp256k1ProverV1 contract batch validation system contain a critical flaw that allows single validators to be counted multiple times during batch approval. This enables attackers to bypass the 66.67% consensus requirement using duplicate entries from the same validator.

## Vulnerability Details 
When a new batch is submitted, validators provide cryptographic proofs and signatures to confirm its validity. The contract checks these signatures and tallies the voting power of participating validators.

but considering the flaw, the current implementation processes validator entries in a loop without checking for duplicates. This means:
A single validator can appear multiple times in the same batch

Their voting power gets counted each time they appear

The total voting power becomes artificially inflated
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < validatorList.length; i++) {
    // As no duplicate check here
    totalPower += validatorList[i].power; 
}
```


## POC

**Validator Setup:**

The Total Validator Power is 100M

Attacker Control 1 Validator (30M power)

**Malicious Batch Submission:**

The Attacker submit same validator's proof/signature 3 times

then the Voting power calculation is  30M * 3 = 90M

so the Fake consensus becomes 90M/100M = 90% exceeding the  66.67% threshold
```bash
90M (Fake Total) / 100M (True Total) = 90%
```

## Impact 
it enable fraudulent transactions using invalid batches
Protocol can accept forged data

## Recommendation 
Add validator uniqueness check to prevent duplicate signatures in batch processing
