# Valid Batches May Be Rejected If a Higher-Height Batch Gets Included First on an EVM chain

### Summary

The requirement for batch heights to increase monotonically on the origin chain (where the request was posted) can cause valid batches to be rejected. If two valid batches are produced and signed on the Seda chain, and two solvers attempt to post them to the origin chain, a batch with a higher height might be included and executed first. This will cause the batch with a lower height to revert and never be executed. Additionally, malicious solvers can deliberately front-run others to grief them.

### Root Cause

In [`Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90), the requirement that batch heights must strictly increase leads to an issue where:

- Two valid batches exist (signed on the SEDA chain), but the one with the higher height is executed first on the chain where the request was posted.

- The function does not account for non-deterministic transaction ordering in some chains. In chains that do not follow first-come first-served sequencing rules (eg. Ethereum), even if `postBatch` was called for the batch with lower height first, the batch with a higher height may get included and executed first instead. This will result in the lower-height batch never being included because of the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L97):
```solidity
if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```

- This allows solvers who have a valid batch to front-run other solvers' valid batches and force lower-height batches to fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions



1. The Seda chain produces and signs two valid batches.

2. Two solvers attempt to post these batches to the origin chain using postBatch.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The origin chain does not enforce first-come, first-served execution.

### Attack Path

1. Solver A prepares to submit batch 105.

2. Solver B sees solver's A transaction and frontruns it with batch 106.

3. The origin chain executes batch 106 first.

4. When Solver A's batch 105 is included, it fails due to `InvalidBatchHeight()`.

5. The request that batch 105 was meant to fulfill remains unresolved.

### Impact

- Solvers suffer potential financial losses due to transaction fees and wasted effort.

- Requests on the origin chain may not get fulfilled, delaying operations dependent on these batches.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Allow posting out-of-order batches: Implement a buffer period where out-of-order batches can still be posted within a certain timeframe.

- Introduce a reordering mechanism: Modify the postBatch function to allow a lower-height batch to still be processed under certain conditions.
