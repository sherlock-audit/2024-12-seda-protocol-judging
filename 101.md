# Unchecked Validator Jailing Logic

### Summary

In the function prepForZeroHeightGenesis, the logic for jailing validators is flawed:

Problem: Validators May Be Incorrectly Jailed or Left Active

if applyAllowedAddrs && !allowedAddrsMap[addr.String()] {
	validator.Jailed = true
}



Impact:

If applyAllowedAddrs == false, no validators are jailed, even if they were previously jailed.

This means slashed or malicious validators could regain active status after state reset.
Validators who should be jailed (e.g., for double-signing or liveness violations) may be incorrectly unjailed in a zero-height genesis scenario.
Attack Vector:

A previously jailed validator could bypass slashing penalties and start again as active.
If combined with weak governance, a malicious validator set could take control of the network after reset.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Explicitly Maintain Jailing Status
Instead of setting validator.Jailed = true only when applyAllowedAddrs is true, ensure that:

Previously jailed validators remain jailed unless explicitly allowed.
Allowed validators must be explicitly specified, not inferred.



if !allowedAddrsMap[addr.String()] {
	validator.Jailed = true
} else {
	validator.Jailed = false // Only explicitly allowed addresses are unjailed
}
