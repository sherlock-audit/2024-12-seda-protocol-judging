# Locked Funds on Payment Failure in SedaCoreV1.resolveRequest

### Summary

The absence of a fallback mechanism for payment failures will cause locked funds for the protocol as an attacker will trigger a revert during payment distribution, leaving funds inaccessible.





### Root Cause

In `SedacoreV1` the [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L70) lacks a fallback mechanism, causing the transaction to revert and lock funds if the recipient cannot receive ETH (e.g., reverts or runs out of gas).


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `postRequest` to set a pending `request` with 1 ETH value on each chain, setting `request.requester` to a malicious contract.
2. Solver Network needs to process a batch to set `batches[batchHeight]` with a valid `resultsRoot` via postBatch in `Secp256k1ProverV1`.
3. Contract needs to have sufficient ETH balance to be at least 1 ETH per request for distribution.


### External Pre-conditions

- The recipient address (e.g., `request.requester`) needs to be a contract with a revert-inducing `receive` or `fallback` function.
- Gas limit on Ethereum needs to be sufficient (e.g., 500k gas) but allow the recipient contract to exhaust it during payment.




### Attack Path

1. User/Attacker calls `SedaCoreV1.postRequest` ([Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L85)) to submit a 1 ETH request on each chain, setting `request.requester` to a malicious contract (this is the overload from your image, line 85).

2. Solver Network processes the request, posting a batch via `Secp256k1ProverV1.postBatch` ([Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L61)) to set a valid `resultsRoot`.

3. Solver submits the proof to `SedaCoreV1.resolveRequest` ([Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L70)), which calls `ResultHandlerBase.postResultAndGetBatchSender` internally to verify the proof.

4. Contract attempts to distribute 1 ETH to `request.requester` in `resolveRequest` [Gh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L85)  using `payable(request.requester).transfer(amount)`.

5. Attacker, as requester causes the `transfer` to revert (e.g., via a malicious `receive` function in their contract), making the entire `resolveRequest` transaction revert and locking the 1 ETH per request without a refund mechanism.



### Impact

- The protocol suffers an approximate loss of access to 50 ETH across all affected chains (10 ETH per chain, assuming 10 requests at 1 ETH each). The attacker loses approximately 0.01 ETH per transaction in gas costs on Ethereum (at $50/tx with 20 gwei gas price and 500k gas) or ~0.000002 ETH per chain on Ink ($0.01/tx), and gains nothing directly (griefing attack).



### PoC

```solidity
// Simplified PoC to demonstrate Locked Funds on Payment Failure
contract MaliciousRecipient {
    receive() external payable {
        revert("Payment rejected"); // Simulate payment failure
    }
}

contract LockedFundsAttacker {
    SedaCoreV1 public seda;
    MaliciousRecipient public malicious;

    constructor(address _seda) {
        seda = SedaCoreV1(_seda);
        malicious = new MaliciousRecipient();
    }

    function attack(bytes calldata request) external payable {
        // Post request with malicious recipient as requester
        seda.postRequest{value: 1 ether}(request); // Uses the overload at L85 from your image
        // Solver processes (manual step), then resolveRequest triggers payment failure
        // Funds lock on failure
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Replace `transfer` with a `call` and add a fallback mechanism in `resolveRequest` in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L85 to handle payment failures and prevent funds from being locked:
```solidity
(bool success, ) = request.requester.call{value: amount}("");
if (!success) {
    // Refund to a protocol-controlled escrow or owner
    payable(owner()).transfer(amount); // Assume owner is defined
    emit PaymentFailed(request.requester, amount);
}
```
Alternatively, validate the recipientâ€™s ability to accept ETH before distribution (e.g., check `address(request.requester).code.length == 0` to avoid contracts).
