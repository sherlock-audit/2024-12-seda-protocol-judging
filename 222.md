# Use of Vulnerable IBC-Go v8.4.0 - Non-Deterministic JSON Unmarshalling Can Cause Chain Halt

### Summary

The protocol is using IBC-Go v8.4.0, which contains a critical vulnerability ([ASA-2025-004](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/security/advisories/GHSA-jg6f-48ff-5xrw)) in the deserialization of IBC acknowledgements. This flaw results in non-deterministic behavior, which can lead to a chain halt if an attacker opens an IBC channel and sends a specially crafted acknowledgement packet.

Since any user with permission to open an IBC channel can exploit this issue, the vulnerability has an almost certain likelihood of occurrence, making it a critical security risk.

### Root Cause

Usage of [IBC-Go v8.4.0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-chain/go.mod#L32), 

### Impact

An attacker can halt the chain by introducing a malformed acknowledgement packet.


### Mitigation

Upgrade to the latest patched version of IBC-Go: v8.6.1
