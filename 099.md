# Duplicate Vote Count in PostBatch function

### Summary

The postBatch function does not prevent counting a validator's vote more than once, allowing an attacker to inflate voting power by submitting duplicate proofs.

https://github.com/sedaprotocol/seda-evm-contracts/blob/07f329125cb62eacce32f5057ba8e59fc4c67f7d/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90

### Root Cause

The function loops through validator proofs and sums their voting power without verifying that each validator is processed only once. This lack of de-duplication lets an attacker submit multiple proofs for the same validator.

### Internal Pre-conditions

An attacker must have access to valid validator signatures and proofs.
The same validatorâ€™s proof can be submitted more than once.
The contract does not enforce any uniqueness constraint on the validator proofs.

### External Pre-conditions

nothing

### Attack Path

1. The attacker collects valid validator proofs.
2. The attacker duplicates one or more proofs from the same validator.
3. The attacker submits these duplicate proofs to the postBatch function.
4. The contract aggregates the duplicated voting power, potentially meeting the consensus threshold

### Impact

 An attacker could artificially meet the consensus threshold.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a mapping to track validator addresses that have already contributed their vote for a given batch.
