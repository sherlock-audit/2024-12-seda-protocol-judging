# Users Can Manipulate `gasLimit` to Maximize Refunds

### Summary

The current gas refund mechanism in the protocol incentivizes users to artificially inflate their gas limit (`gasLimit`) to maximize their refund. Since the refund is calculated based on the proportion of gas used (`gasUsed`) to `gasLimit`, users who set an unrealistically high gas limit will receive a larger refund, potentially disrupting the fee distribution system.

### Root Cause

The issue stems from the formula used to [calculate the submitter fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162):
```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
```
Since `gasLimit` is provided by the user and appears in the denominator, increasing `gasLimit` reduces the fraction of the request fee allocated to the submitter. The remaining portion is refunded to the requestor, allowing them to receive an artificially high refund:
```solidity
refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
```
There is no downside for the user providing high gas limit since the amount they pay to the submitter is capped by `requestFee`, which they also set as an input, and protects them from overpaying (the maximum amount they would pay is equal to the request fee regardless of how high the gas limit is).

The gas limit should serve to indicate the maximum amount the user is willing to pay for the request, but in the current code implementation it works as: the higher the gas limit, the lower the amount the user pays.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User specifies a high gas limit when submitting a request. Note that the gas limit may still appear reasonable from the solver's perspective, while the user strategically inflates it to maximize their refund at the solver's expense, reducing their profit.

2. Gas used (`gasUsed`) is lower than the gas limit provided.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User submits a request with an exaggerated gas limit.

2. The request executes and only consumes a small fraction of the gas limit.

3. The fee distribution formula calculates a small submitter fee due to the large denominator.

4. User receives an excessively high refund.

5. If many users exploit this, submitters may receive inadequate fees, discouraging participation in the network.

### Impact

- Result submitters (solvers) receive lower fees, reducing their incentive to execute requests.

- The protocol's fee distribution system becomes unbalanced, leading to economic inefficiencies.

- Potential denial-of-service scenario where genuine requests are not processed due to low solver incentives.




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

We recommend modifying the request fee distribution as following. The submitter's fee is calculated as:
```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee;
```
and the refund to the user is calculated as
```solidity
refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee * requestDetails.gasLimit - submitterFee;
```
where `requestFee` is the fee the user is willing to pay **per gas used** (note that the new `requestFee` is now in different units, i.e. amount/gas, while the original `requestFee` is just an amount).

This ensures that the `gasLimit` parameter effectively sets the maximum amount the user is willing to pay while guaranteeing fair compensation for the submitter.

We recommend the following changes to the code.
First ensure that `requestFee * gasLimit` is transferred to the contract in `SedaCoreV1::postRequest`:
```diff
// Validate that the sent ETH matches exactly the sum of all specified fees
        // This prevents users from accidentally overpaying or underpaying fees
-        if (msg.value != requestFee + resultFee + batchFee) {
+        if (msg.value != requestFee * (inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit) + resultFee + batchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }
```
Then modify the fee distribution in `SedaCoreV1::postResult`:
```diff
// Split request fee proportionally based on gas used vs gas limit
-               uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
+              uint256 submitterFee = result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee;
                if (submitterFee > 0) {
                    _transferFee(payableAddress, submitterFee);
                    emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, payableAddress, submitterFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.REQUEST);
                }
-               refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
+               refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee * requestDetails.gasLimit - submitterFee;
```

Modify the amount payed when increasing fees in `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees`:
```diff
// Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
+       RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
-        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
+        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee * details.gasLimit + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
         }

-        RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
```

Modify the total refund in `SedaCoreV1::withdrawTimedOutRequest`:
```diff
// Calculate total refund
-       uint256 totalRefund = details.requestFee + details.resultFee + details.batchFee;
+       uint256 totalRefund = details.requestFee * details.gasLimit + details.resultFee + details.batchFee;
```
