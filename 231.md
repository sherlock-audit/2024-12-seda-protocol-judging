# Attacker can front-run Withdraw and steal the withdrawal

### Summary

The Withdraw message in the Seda Core contract [sends](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L36-L39) the withdrawn tokens to the message sender. This enables anyone to front-run the withdrawal with the same message to steal the withdrawn amount.

### Root Cause

- The withdrawn tokens are [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L36-L39) to the message sender.
```rust
  let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
      to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
      amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
  };
```
- No [checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L8-L33) are done on the message sender, so it can be anyone.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes a Withdraw message with valid proof.
2. Attacker frontruns the Withdraw copying the same message to steal the withdrawn amount.

### Impact

Permanent loss of funds for the Staker.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider sending the withdrawn tokens to a pre-approved address instead of the `info.sender`.
