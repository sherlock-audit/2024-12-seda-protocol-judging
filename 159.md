# When the `postResult()` is made by the solver, it can be frontrun by calling it with same arguments by anyone with higher gas on EVM chains

### Summary

The function [`postResult`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122-L202) is a public function callable by anyone.

It is called for posting data results back on the EVM oracle program that made the data request.

The problem is that this function can be called by anyone, especially provided that there is an incentive `resultFee` that will be sent to the address that invoked this function with same set of arguments (like proof)

1. Taking away the complete `requestDetails.resultFee` which gets transferred to the caller (msg.sender being attacker here by frontrunning the legit tx of the solver, since most of the EVM chains mempool is public allowing anyone to check the pending transactions)
2. Receiving the `requestDetails.batchFee` amount that aims to incentivize the batch sender of the data result. Since this fn internally makes a call to `ResultHanderBase.sol::postResultAndGetBatchSender()` which in turn calls [`verifyResultProof()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L156-L164) of prover contract

```solidity
        (bytes32 resultId, address batchSender) = super.postResultAndGetBatchSender(result, batchHeight, proof);
```
The batchSender address is determined by call to `postBatch()` from Secp256k1ProverV1.sol contract which can also be frontrunned allowing the attacker to register themselves as `BatchData.sender` in the contract's storage.

If they become the batchsender, then when calling the aforementioned fn call `postResult()` would also yield them the `batchFee` amount to their own address for all the request results for the present value of `batches`.

### Root Cause

Function doesn't have any access control, allowing it to being frontrunned by any actor/attacker to gain the assured `resultFee` transferred to their address, even if they couldn't timely frontrun the `postBatch()` for the current batch where they could become the batchSender and also get the batchFee transferred to their address. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. When the data result from seda chain is computed and is being posted via `postResult()` on EVM chain for the oracle to access/use it.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. When the data result from seda chain is computed and is being posted via `postResult()` on EVM chain for the oracle to access/use it.
2. An attacker can monitor the mempool and frontrun the fn call tx, by calling the same fn with more gas fee, to get their tx mined faster and before the legit call made by the seda-chain actor, when the legit call happens, it will revert with `ResultAlreadyExists` error message.
3. The attacker being the one who posted the result, will receive the `resultFee` for the corresponding data request for which the result was posted.

### Impact

The attacker gets profited with the `resultFee` incentive, instead of the legitimate actor (solver). Causing inefficiency when and confusion of state, thinking that they tried to replay the data result posting, which might be a negative metric to their performance. 

### PoC

The following [test](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/test/core/SedaCoreV1.test.ts#L199-L212) is taken from existing test suite that shows that when the call is being fronturn the legitimate calls gets reverted bringing no incentive for the legit actor : 

```typescript   
 it('rejects duplicate results', async () => {
      const { core, data } = await loadFixture(deployCoreFixture);

      // Post initial request
      await core.postRequest(data.requests[0]);

      // Post first result - should succeed
      await core.postResult(data.results[0], 0, data.proofs[0]);

      // Attempt to post the same result again - should fail
      await expect(core.postResult(data.results[0], 0, data.proofs[0]))
        .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(core, 'ResultAlreadyExists')
        .withArgs(data.results[0].drId);
    });
```

### Mitigation

Use a trusted relay or oracle to submit results on behalf of users.
Restrict the postResult function to only be callable by the trusted relay/oracle.
Users submit their results to the relay/oracle off-chain, which then submits them on-chain, later the relayer can transfer the incentive to the intended address that should receive the fees.

```solidity
address public trustedRelay;

modifier onlyTrustedRelay() {
    require(msg.sender == trustedRelay, "Caller is not the trusted relay");
    _;
}

function postResult(
    SedaDataTypes.Result calldata result,
    uint64 batchHeight,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) public payable override(ResultHandlerBase, IResultHandler) onlyTrustedRelay whenNotPaused returns (bytes32) {
```
