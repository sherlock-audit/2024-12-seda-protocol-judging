# A result can be censored by a request poster that submits a `payback_address` that can not accept ETH transfers

### Summary

A result can be censored by a request poster that submits a `payback_address` that can not accept ETH transfers. The
[`SedaCore::postResult()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122-L126) call will be DOS'd for the targeted result.

### Root Cause

- The [`payback_address`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L92) can be any value set by the request poster in the Core SEDA Chain contract.
- In [`SedaCoreV1::postResult():153-169`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L153-L169), the `paybackAddress` is only checked that it is not the zero address.
It then proceeds to send native tokens to the payback address.
```solidity
if (requestDetails.requestFee > 0) {
    // @audit the `result.paybackAddress` is set by the request poster on the SEDA Chain Core contract and can
    // be any value they want.
    address payableAddress = result.paybackAddress.length == 20
        ? address(bytes20(result.paybackAddress))
        : address(0);

    if (payableAddress == address(0)) {
        refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee;
    } else {
        // Split request fee proportionally based on gas used vs gas limit
        uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
        if (submitterFee > 0) {
            _transferFee(payableAddress, submitterFee); // ==================> This does an ETH transfer
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, payableAddress, submitterFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.REQUEST);
        }
        refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
    }
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None

### External Pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path

1. A user [posts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L91-L118) a valid data request on the EVM Core contract with a non-zero request fee. 
2. An attacker [posts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L9) this request to the SEDA Chain Core contract setting the `payback_address` to a Smart Contract that can not accept ETH transfers.
3. When a solver attempts to post the result on the EVM Core contract, it reverts due to transferring ETH to a contract without a payable `receive()` or `fallback()` handler.


### Impact

The DOS of `postResult()` for a target Result effectively censors it. The requester's funds are stuck but can be recovered on an upgrade.

### PoC
None.


### Mitigation
Consider catching any failed transfers and adding the `requestFee` to the `refundAmount`.
