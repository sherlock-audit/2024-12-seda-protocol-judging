# Panic Triggered by Invalid State Update in Tallying Requests

In the [update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/state/data_requests_map.rs#L83-L152) function, when attempting to update a data request that is already in the **Tallying** state, the contract uses an unconditional assertion that always fails. The relevant code snippet is:  
```rust
DataRequestStatus::Tallying => {
    assert_ne!(
        current_status,
        DataRequestStatus::Tallying,
        "Cannot update a request's status that is tallying"
    );
}
```  
Since this branch is reached only when `current_status` is already `Tallying`, the `assert_ne!` condition is inevitably violated, triggering a panic every time. This hard panic prevents any further processing of the request update, leading to abrupt transaction reversion instead of a controlled error handling process.

### Primary Root Cause  
The primary root cause is the misuse of the `assert_ne!` macro in the `DataRequestStatus::Tallying` branch, where the logic erroneously checks for inequality against a state that is already confirmed, causing an unavoidable failure in any update attempt.

### Impact  
The immediate impact is a denial-of-service condition where any update on a request in the Tallying state results in a panic, potentially locking the associated state and funds and halting the contractâ€™s normal operation.

### Mitigation  
Replace the unconditional assertion with proper error handling that returns a controlled error message when an update on a Tallying request is attempted.
