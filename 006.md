# Anyone can call increaseFees, even though it is intended to be called only by the owner.

### Summary

The SedaCoreV1 contract has an increaseFees function, described as "Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request," but there is no restriction on who can call this function, making it permissionless and breaking the invariant.

### Root Cause

In `SedaCoreV1:206` ( [[link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206) ), the `increaseFees` function is intended to be called only by admins because it modifies important data that should only be changed by a trusted authority. However, it is not restricted, as there is no `onlyOwner` modifier or any other access control.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has a pending request

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Anyone calls increaseFees, raising the fees to unintended values.



### Impact

The invariant is broken because sensitive data can be changed by any user, despite comments stating that this should only be done by a trusted authority - the owner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the onlyOwner modifier to the increaseFees function.
