# Use of Obsolete Cosmos SDK v0.50.11 - Vulnerable to Chain Halt via Malicious Proposal (ASA-2025-003)

## Description:
The protocol is using an outdated version of the Cosmos SDK ([v0.50.11](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-chain/go.mod#L27)), which contains a critical vulnerability in the groups module. This flaw ([ASA-2025-003](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-x5vx-95h7-rv4p)) allows a malicious proposal to trigger a division by zero error, resulting in a chain halt.

Since any user interacting with the groups module can introduce this state, the issue presents a high likelihood of exploitation with severe consequences for the protocol's availability.

## Root Cause
Usage of v0.50.11

## Impact:
Any malicious user can halt the entire blockchain by submitting a specially crafted proposal.

## Recommended Fix:
Upgrade to the latest patched version of the Cosmos SDK: v0.50.12
