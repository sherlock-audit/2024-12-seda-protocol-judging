# Some tally gas used is not consumed, For cases where the `remainingTallyGas` is less than that Used


### Summary
Not consuming the remaining gas in `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go::ConsumeTallyGas` by setting it to zero yet in `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go::ConsumeExecGasForProxy` and `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go::ConsumeExecGasForExcutor` is consumed, leads to the protocal being paid less gas than it should.

### Root Cause
Not consuming the remaining gas in `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go/ConsumeTallyGas` by setting it to zero  as done in `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go/ConsumeExecGasForProxy`

### Internal Pre-conditions
Less gas than than required.

### Vulnerabilty Details
The tallyGas is used to compasate for system resources used during the tally process and the amount calculated from it is burned at the end of the excution. During tallying this amount  should be subtracted from the remaining amount but for cases where  the amount is less this amount will not be consumed. But for proxy and excutor gas, this remaining gas is consumed.

[Data Proxy Gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L113C2-L116C3):
```go
if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
==>		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}
```

[Executor Gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L132C2-L135C3):
```go
        if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
==>		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}
```
This causes issues where the contract may have used nearly this remaining gas amount and consuming this gas will compasate a signicant portion of the gasUsed. Lets say a call to the vm-programId with results where a sightly more gas will be used. When a call is made to the gasMeter no gas will be consumed.

```go
      gasMeter.ConsumeTallyGas(vmRes.GasUsed)
```
[vm_tally.go::ExcuteTallyProgram](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/tally_vm.go#L64)

[The cosume gas function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L92C1-L100C1):
```go
func (g *GasMeter) ConsumeTallyGas(amount uint64) bool {

    //Not setting remaining gas to zero if the amount is less will make the excution that called this function 
   //completely free yet a portion of the used gas would have been consumed to compesate for some of the resources used
	if amount > g.tallyGasRemaining {
		return true
	}

	g.tallyGasRemaining -= amount
	return false
}
```

User can use this to setLimited gas intentionally knowing it will be refunded

### Attack Path
User sets gasLimit in his data request that is enough to filter reveals but not enough for the `TallyprogramId` call( which also consumes tallyGas). The filter will pass successfully and its gas consumed, but the call to the `TallyprogramId` will be completely free since even the less remaining tally gas will not be consumed to compesate for a portion of the gasUsed.

### Impact
The protocal will burn less gas than should and allow user to run some tasks that should consume gas completely free without any payment.

### Mitigation
Consider making the following modifications to `ConsumeTallyGas`:-

```diff
func (g *GasMeter) ConsumeTallyGas(amount uint64) bool {

	if amount > g.tallyGasRemaining {
+++       g.tallyGasRemaining = 0;
		return true
	}

	g.tallyGasRemaining -= amount
	return false
}
```
