# Chain can deadlock due to no consensus because New Validators can not submit vote extensions

### Summary

New validators will increase the total voting power, but their vote on vote extensions will not be counted for 1 block. 

A validator's vote must be counted for the current block if they have an entry in a previous batch.
When the following condition is true:

```pseudocode
SumOfNewValidatorsPower > 1/3 TotalVotingPower
```

`PrepareProposal()` and `ProcessProposal()` will always fail when [validating vote extensions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L193) and cause a chain halt.

### Root Cause

In [`abci/handlers.go#ExtendVoteHandler():101`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L101), a new Validator will not be able to submit their vote extension because they do not yet have an entry in a previous batch. 

```golang
  // Check if the validator was in the previous validator tree.
  // If not, it means the validator just joined the active set,
  // so it should start signing from the next batch.
  _, err = h.batchingKeeper.GetValidatorTreeEntry(ctx, batch.BatchNumber-1, h.signer.GetValAddress())
```

This [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L370-L379) is also enforced in `VerifyVoteExtensionHandler()`, where a vote extension must be submitted
by a validator with an entry in a previous batch.

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. The total power of New Validators is greater than 1/3.


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. All the vote extensions of New Validators are not submitted, which makes up for more than 1/3 of total voting power.
2. When the proposal is [Prepared](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L193) or [Processed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L256), 
`ValidateVoteExtensions()` will always fail because it [requires consensus](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L143-L149) on vote extensions.

### Impact

Chain halt because consensus will always fail on vote extensions no matter the proposer.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider modifying `ValidateVoteExtensions()` and filtering out the New Validators from being counted for [TotalVotingPower](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L83).
