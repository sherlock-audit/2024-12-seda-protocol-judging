# Fee Manipulation Vulnerability in Request Execution

### Summary

The absence of validation between `requestFee` and `gasLimit` allows users to manipulate fee distribution. This  lead to executors not receiving full gas compensation or users evading request fees by setting an excessively high `gasLimit`, causing the fee calculation to round to zero.

### Root Cause

The contract computes the executor's compensation using the formula:  

\[ submitterFee = (gasUsed * requestFee) / gasLimit \]

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162

However, `requestFee` is not validated against `gasLimit`, allowing users to set an arbitrarily high `gasLimit`, making `gasUsed * requestFee / gasLimit` round to zero.

The requestFee should always cover at least the gasLimit (which includes execGasLimit + tallyGasLimit), as this represents the maximum amount of gas an executor will spend and seek reimbursement for.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A malicious user submits a request with an abnormally high `gasLimit`
- An  executor processes the request, expecting to be reimbursed for gas usage.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The attacker submits a request with a `requestFee` and an high `gasLimit`.
2. The executor processes the request, consuming gas (The actual request cost is relatively low, so the gas used is much less than the gas limit.)
3. The fee calculation rounds to zero, preventing the executor from receiving any meaningful compensation.
4. The attacker benefits by having their request executed at  no cost.-

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

- **For Executors:** They will not receive full gas reimbursement.

- **For Users:** Attackers can evade paying request fees by manipulating the `gasLimit`

- **For the Protocol:** Reduces reliability

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure `requestFee` is at least ` gasLimit` to guarantee fair executor compensation.
