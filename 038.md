# Cross-domain signature replay attack

### Summary 
The `verifyResultProof` function uses a constant domain separator (`0x00`) to stop replay attacks. however, this fixed value does not tie a proof to a specific chain, allowing a valid result proof to be replayed on other chains.


### Vulnerability Details 
The function hashes the result id with a [constant domain separator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/abstract/ProverBase.sol#L13-L14) (`0x00`) and verifies the proof against the batchâ€™s results root. Because the separator never changes, the same proof can work on different chains, enabling replay attacks.

```solidity
    function verifyResultProof(
        bytes32 resultId,
        uint64 batchHeight,
        bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
    ) external view override(ProverBase) returns (bool, address) {
        BatchData memory batch = _storageV1().batches[batchHeight];
        bytes32 leaf = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(RESULT_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, resultId));
        return MerkleProof.verify(merkleProof, batch.resultsRoot, leaf) ? (true, batch.sender) : (false, address(0));
    }

```

### Impact 
An attacker can reuse valid result proofs across chains. This may allow unauthorized acceptance of results and abuse of protocol features on other networks.


### Mitigation 
Use a dynamic domain separator that includes chain-specific or deployment-specific data (such as the chain id) so that result proofs are valid only on their intended chain.
