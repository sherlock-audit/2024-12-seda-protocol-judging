# An attacker can block data request delivery to the SEDA chain

### Summary

Anyone can deliver an exact request from EVM chains to the SEDA chain but can pay little to no fees effectively blocking its processing.

### Root Cause

In [`post_request:21-27`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L21-L27) there is check to ensure no duplicate requests can be posted:

```rust
        // hash the inputs to get the data request id
        let dr_id = self.posted_dr.try_hash()?;

        // require the data request id to be unique
        if state::data_request_exists(deps.as_ref(), dr_id) {
            return Err(ContractError::DataRequestAlreadyExists);
        }
```

It is worth noting that the hashing method is identical between the [EVM](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L124-L138) and [Rust](https://github.com/sedaprotocol/seda-common-rs/blob/main/crates/common/src/msgs/data_requests/types.rs#L185-L200) implementations to ensure the request ID on the SEDA chain matches the ID on the source chain.

This allows an attacker to perform a DoS attack on data requests by posting them into the SEDA chain with minimal fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user posts a new data request to the Ethereum chain with enough fees attached for the processing.
2. An attacker reads the request and posts it to the SEDA core contract but with 0 or 1 unit of fees attached.
3. Overlay nodes ignore that data request as there are no fees to profit from it.
4. The honest solver nodes cannot deliver such a request as it already exists.
5. Data request times out without being processed.

### Impact

Data request processing can be DoS'd at the cost of around gas fees.
