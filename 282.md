# DoS Vulnerability in Vesting Module's `Clawback()` Function

### Summary

The vesting module's [Clawback()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/vesting/keeper/msg_server.go#L103) function contains a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to an unbounded iteration over token balances. An attacker can exploit this by sending numerous token types to a vesting account, making the clawback operation fail due to excessive gas consumption. 

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from using `GetAllBalances` which performs an unbounded iteration over all token denominations held by an address. The gas cost scales linearly with the number of different token types, regardless of their amounts.


### Internal Pre-conditions

No

### External Pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies a target vesting account
2. Attacker creates multiple token types (can be minimal amounts)
3. Attacker spams these tokens to the target vesting account
4. When clawback is attempted, `GetAllBalances()` must process every token type
5. The attacker can strategically overload the array, causing significant gas consumption and ultimately causing the `Clawback()` function to fail.

### Impact

Clawback functions can be made to fail by exceeding gas limits and legitimate clawback attempts can be prevented. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace unbounded GetAllBalances with targeted balance retrieval.
