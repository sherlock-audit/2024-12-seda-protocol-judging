# Unstake Operation Allows Stakers’ Balances to Drop Below Required Minimum, Causing State Inconsistency

In the [unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/unstake.rs#L6-L39) function, the contract deducts tokens from a staker’s balance without verifying that the remaining balance meets the [minimum stake requirement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L28-L30), which is explicitly enforced during the initial staking process. For example, the code snippet below shows that after verifying sufficient funds:  
```rust
if self.amount > executor.tokens_staked {
    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientFunds(executor.tokens_staked, self.amount));
}
executor.tokens_staked -= self.amount;
executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal += self.amount;
state::STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
```  
there is no check to ensure that `executor.tokens_staked` remains at or above the `minimum_stake_to_register` (as defined in `state::STAKING_CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?.minimum_stake_to_register`). This omission results in a scenario where a staker can reduce their balance below the minimum threshold, potentially disrupting downstream operations that rely on this invariant.

**Primary Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the issue is the absence of a post-withdrawal validation in the unstake function, which fails to enforce that the staker's remaining tokens meet the minimum required stake, unlike the check implemented in the stake function.

**Impact:**  
The immediate impact is that stakers can inadvertently or intentionally reduce their balance to an inconsistent state, leading to potential miscalculations in reward distributions or governance processes, which may cause significant service disruptions.

**Mitigation:**  
Enforce a check after the unstake operation to ensure that the remaining tokens meet the minimum stake requirement or update the staker's status accordingly in a single conditional validation.
