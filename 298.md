# Malicious contracts can force excessive memory usage at minimal gas cost, threatening node stability and economic security

### Summary

Incorrect implementation of WebAssembly memory growth gas metering will cause a resource exhaustion vulnerability for blockchain node operators as attackers will deploy contracts that allocate large amounts of memory while bypassing appropriate gas costs.

### Root Cause

In `metering.rs`  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/metering.rs#L56

In the gas metering code for WebAssembly operations, specifically in the `get_wasm_operation_gas_cost` function:

```rust
Operator::MemoryGrow { mem, mem_byte: _ } => {
    GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE + ((WASM_PAGE_SIZE as u64 * *mem as u64) * GAS_PER_BYTE)
}
```

The implementation incorrectly uses the memory index (`mem`) instead of the actual number of pages being allocated. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the WebAssembly specification, where:

1. The `mem` parameter refers to the memory index (which memory segment to operate on)
2. The actual number of pages to grow is a runtime value taken from the stack
3. In most WebAssembly modules, `mem` is 0 (since they only have one memory section)

This leads to almost all memory growth operations only being charged the base fee (`GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE`), regardless of how many pages are actually allocated.

### Relevant specifications and references:

MDN documentation clearly states that the page count parameter for memory.grow is passed through the stack, as in (memory.grow (i32.const 1)). https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/Memory/Grow

The operational semantics of memory.grow in the WebAssembly Core Specification explicitly depends on the runtime stack top value (see Instructions section in Chapter 6).  https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/syntax/instructions.html

The JavaScript API design of WebAssembly.Memory.grow() also verifies that the page count is a dynamic parameter
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Memory/grow

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A WebAssembly module needs to include memory growth operations (`memory.grow`)
2. The blockchain system must be using this gas metering implementation
3. The contract must be accepted by the blockchain validators/nodes

### External Pre-conditions

None identified.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates a malicious WebAssembly contract that includes `memory.grow` operations requesting large amounts of memory (hundreds or thousands of pages)
2. Attacker deploys this contract to the blockchain
3. When the contract executes, it calls `memory.grow` with a large value
4. The VM charges only `GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE` gas (fixed cost) for this operation, regardless of the actual memory pages allocated
5. The contract can now use this large memory allocation for computation without having paid the appropriate gas costs
6. Attacker can repeat this process with multiple contracts, causing excessive memory consumption across blockchain nodes

### Impact

The blockchain nodes suffer excessive resource consumption without corresponding gas payments. This could lead to:

1. Reduced node performance due to memory pressure
2. Potential denial of service for legitimate transactions
3. Breaking of the economic model intended to balance resource usage with gas costs
4. In extreme cases, nodes may crash due to out-of-memory conditions

The economic impact is significant as attackers can execute operations that should cost `GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE + (WASM_PAGE_SIZE * actual_pages * GAS_PER_BYTE)` but instead only pay `GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE`.

### PoC

```rust
// Simple WebAssembly module (in text format) that exploits this vulnerability:
(module
  (memory 1)
  (func $exploit (result i32)
    ;; Try to grow memory by 1000 pages (65MB)
    i32.const 1000
    memory.grow
  )
  (export "exploit" (func $exploit))
)
```
This module would be charged only GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE despite allocating 1000 pages (65MB) of memory.

### Mitigation

The gas metering for memory growth operations should be implemented as a runtime check rather than static analysis. Two approaches are recommended:

1. Modify the metering middleware to inject runtime checks for memory growth:

```rust
// Pseudocode for runtime metering
if operation == memory.grow {
    let pages_to_grow = get_value_from_stack();
    let gas_cost = GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE + (WASM_PAGE_SIZE as u64 * pages_to_grow * GAS_PER_BYTE);
    charge_gas(gas_cost);
}
```

2. Implement a host function hook that intercepts memory.grow operations:

```rust
// Host function approach
fn intercept_memory_grow(&mut self, pages: u32) -> Result<i32, Error> {
    let gas_cost = GAS_MEMORY_GROW_BASE + (WASM_PAGE_SIZE as u64 * pages as u64 * GAS_PER_BYTE);
    self.charge_gas(gas_cost)?;
    
    // Proceed with actual memory grow operation
    self.original_memory_grow(pages)
}
```

The fix must be applied immediately as this vulnerability fundamentally breaks the economic security model of the blockchain's resource accounting.
