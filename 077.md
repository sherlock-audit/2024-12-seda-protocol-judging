# Groups Module can Halt Chain when handling a malicious Proposal

### Summary

**NOTE:** This report is highly influenced by this [issue](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-x5vx-95h7-rv4p) discorvered in Cosmos Sdk affected versions: <= v0.47.15, <= 0.50.11. The fixed version was made available on February 20th.

Seda's system is currently running a vulnerable version of Cosmos, which would lead to a chain halt when the group module handle's a malicious proposal.

In Seda's go.mod, the Cosmos SDK version is set to v0.50.11
```go
github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk v0.50.11 
```

This version is currently vulnerable to chain halt when the the group module handles a malicious proposal.

As seen [here](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-x5vx-95h7-rv4p#:~:text=Affected%20versions%3A%20%3C%3D%20v0.47.15%2C%20%3C%3D%200.50.11) the affected versions are `Affected versions: <= v0.47.15, <= 0.50.11`

The system currently runs at [0.50.11](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/go.mod#L27) as the time of this audit, making it a valid concern.

The affected users are: Validators, Full Nodes, Users that utilize the groups module.

As seen from the link, it clearly states 
>>There are no known workarounds for this issue. It is advised that chains apply the update.

This is at least a medium severity issue and should be fixed by the protocol as soon as possible.

### Root Cause

The root cause stems from the fact Seda's system is currently running a vulnerable version of Cosmos, In Seda's go.mod, the Cosmos SDK version is set to `0.50.11`.
An issue was discovered in the groups module where a malicious proposal would result in a division by zero, and subsequently halt a chain due to the resulting error. Any user that can interact with the groups module can introduce this state.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Running Cosmos SDK version is set to `v0.50.11.`


### External Pre-conditions

Any user that can interact with the groups module can introduce this state

### Attack Path

The vulnerability path is simply where a malicious proposal would result in a division by zero in group module, and causing a chain halt due to the error.
As already stated, any user that can interact with the groups module can introduce this state.

### Impact

The chain will be halted.

### Mitigation

It is advised that the chain apply the update by upgrading to the fixed version.
