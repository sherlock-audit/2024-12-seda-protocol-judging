# Attackers can flood solvers with thousands of requests and prevent fee payouts

### Summary
The current fee distribution model compensates solvers only after the result is posted on-chain—a fee system known as the push model. In this design, solver must call the `postResult` function to trigger fee payments. However, this mechanism can be exploited. An attacker can deploy tens of smart contracts that appear to submit attractive requests with generous fees, but are engineered to revert on native token transfers upon receiving the refund amounts. 
```solidity
        // Example: Attacker switches the `revertOnReceiveEther` in their contract to true, to prevent a result from getting posted
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```
(these contracts may even include an on/off switch that bypasses solvers’ checks for whether the requester can receive Ether). As a result, the network is forced to process these requests. Then, just before the results are posted, the attacker can disable Ether acceptance, thereby preventing fee transfers. Once the timeout period expires, the attacker can withdraw funds from all the requests using `withdrawTimedOutRequest`. In effect, the attacker incurs only minimal gas fees (especially on L2s) while overloading solvers and the Seda chain with tasks.

### Root Cause
After a request is posted, its fees remain in the contract until results are posted using the `postResult` function. The fee distribution occurs only after solvers submit the results and the contract verifies that the `result ID` is included in the batch’s `resultsRoot`.

For the malicious requester to trigger a revert during the native token transfer (thus blocking fee distribution), the `refundAmount` must be greater than zero. This can be achieved by setting the `request.gasLimit` slightly higher than the actual gas used, When the fee is calculated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162
```solidity
                // Split request fee proportionally based on gas used vs gas limit
                //@audit if gasLimit > gasUsed, then submitterFee < requestDetails.requestFee
                uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
                if (submitterFee > 0) {
                    _transferFee(payableAddress, submitterFee);
                    emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, payableAddress, submitterFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.REQUEST);
                }
                //@audit remaining amount to refund
                refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
```
Later, when transferring the refund to the requester:
```solidity
        // Aggregate refund to requestor containing:
        // - unused request fees (when gas used < gas limit)
        // - full request fee (when invalid payback address)
        // - batch fee (when no batch sender)
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```
If the requester is a contract that reverts on receiving native tokens, the transfer will fail. For instance:
```solidity
contract Malicious {
    //...rest of the code
    bool acceptEther;
    receive() external payable {
        if (!acceptEther) revert();
    }
    //...rest of the code
}
```
Finally, after the timeout period (`_storageV1().timeoutPeriod`), the attacker can withdraw the funds from all requests by calling `withdrawTimedOutRequest`.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- Contract not be in `paused` state

### External Pre-conditions
- Solvers are actively picking up requests with sufficiently attractive fees.
- Solvers are posting results back to `SedaCoreV1` using the `postResult` function.
- The requester is a contract engineered to reject native token transfers (with an on/off switch for Ether reception), allowing later withdrawal of funds.

### Attack Path
- The attacker deploys 100 different smart contracts with identical behavior (including an on/off feature for receiving Ether) on Optimism.
- Each malicious contract submits 100 requests with sufficiently high fees to attract solvers.
- Solvers pick up these requests one by one and relay them to the Seda chain.
- The requests are processed on the Seda network.
- The results are batched and posted on-chain.
- When a solver attempts to post the results to claim the fees, the attacker disables Ether reception in the malicious contracts.
- As a result, fee transfers to solvers revert.
- Solvers become congested with 100 × 100 = 10,000 processed requests that yield no fee payouts, overloading the system.

### Impact
- **Uncompensated Solvers and SEDA Chain:**  
  The attack causes solvers to perform all necessary computations and batch processing without receiving any compensation.
  
- **Potential Network Instability:**  
  Over time, the inability to compensate solvers may lead to decline in the overall performance (since attacker can perform major request attacks each time from ananymous contracts) and trust in the blockchain ecosystem.

### Mitigation
Instead of using a push model for fee distribution, a pull model should be adopted. In a pull model, all parties are credited with the appropriate amounts of native tokens within the contract. They can then withdraw these funds at their discretion.
