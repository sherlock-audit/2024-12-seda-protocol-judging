# Users can have a stake lower than the minimum due to a missing check upon unstaking

### Summary

Users can have a stake lower than the minimum due to a missing check upon unstaking

### Root Cause

Upon staking through `stake::execute()`, we have the following code:
```rust
                if amount < minimum_stake_to_register {
                    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientFunds(minimum_stake_to_register, amount));
                }
```
Each staker must have at least the minimum stake required to register. However, this check is missing when unstaking. This allows a staker to go below the minimum with absolutely no constraints regarding it, rendering the initial check completely useless. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No internal pre-conditions_

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

A possible and simple path would be:
1. User stakes the minimum required
2. He unstakes all of his funds which adds to his pending withdrawal amount
3. He finalizes his withdrawal for all but 1 of his pending tokens, that way he doesn't get deleted from the stakers due to this check:
```rust
        if executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal.is_zero() && executor.tokens_staked.is_zero() {
            state::STAKERS.remove(deps.storage, public_key)?;
        }
```
4. He has 0 tokens but is still a staker

### Impact

Users can have a stake below the minimum required

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply a check for the minimum stake amount upon unstaking as well.
