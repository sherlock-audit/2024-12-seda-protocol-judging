# The returned values after gas consumptions are ignored resulting in a situation where gas payments can be avoided

### Summary

Currently, the protocol allows to return false instead of errors and process data requests anyway even if the gas remaining for the given operation is 0

### Root Cause

Different functions for gas consumption return true/false instead of errors and the cases when the gas supplied is not enough allowing to process data requests even if the gas is not sufficient.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Return values are not handled.

### Impact

Gas underconsumption.

### PoC

Let's take a look at how the gas is currently consumed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L92-99
```go

func (g *GasMeter) ConsumeTallyGas(amount uint64) bool {
	if amount > g.tallyGasRemaining {
		return true
	}

	g.tallyGasRemaining -= amount
	return false
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L113-116
```go

	if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}

```

Here, the `tallyGasRemaining` and the `execGasRemaining` are nullified if the required amount is greater than the gas remaining. Therefore, the gas is not consumed correctly and instead of returning an error, the functions just return the boolean values that are not handled at all:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L95
```go

	gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForProxy(pubKey, proxyConfig.PayoutAddress, gasUsedPerExec, replicationFactor)
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L127
```go
	gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForExecutor(committer, gasUsed)
```

And the request is then just processed and is set for batching.

### Mitigation

Consider handle the errors related to the gas consumption correctly, checking for the true/false returning values.
