# VM call_result_value function doesn't charge gas which can result in chain DoS

### Summary

The call_result_value function works as an imported function inside the WASM VM. This function does a byte-by-byte memory write up to 2^32 times. The function neglects to apply a gas price, which could be exploited by a malicious program to cause a whole network DoS


### Root Cause

In `call_result.rs` the `call_result_value` function performs memory operations without applying any gas cost.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/core_vm_imports/call_result.rs#L17
```rust
    fn call_result_value(
        env: FunctionEnvMut<'_, VmContext>,
        result_data_ptr: WasmPtr<u8>,
        result_data_length: u32,
    ) -> Result<()> {
        let ctx = env.data();
        let memory = ctx.memory_view(&env);

        let target = result_data_ptr.slice(&memory, result_data_length)?;
        let call_value = ctx.call_result_value.read();

        for index in 0..result_data_length {
            target.index(index as u64).write(call_value[index as usize])?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
```

This differs from all other imports such as `http_fetch` which properly calculate a gas cost proportional to the result_length:
```rust
    fn http_fetch(mut env: FunctionEnvMut<'_, VmContext>, _result_ptr: WasmPtr<u8>, result_length: i32) -> Result<u32> {
        apply_gas_cost(
            crate::metering::ExternalCallType::HttpFetchRequest(result_length as u64),
            &mut env,
        )?;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A malicious oracle program must be submitted
2. A data request must be made which uses the malicious oracle program

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker crafts a malicious Oracle Program that repeatedly invokes the call_result_value WASM import with the maximum possible result_data_length (approaching 2^32)
2. Attacker submits a request that invoked this oracle program
3. Tally endblock logic executes the malicious program on all validator nodes simultaneously
4. The chain is DoS'd an indeterminate amount of time as all nodes try to complete computation of the malicious program
5. When the nodes eventually finish computation, the user who submitted the data request is charged a small amount of gas un-proportional to the amount of computation 

### Impact

This is a critical DoS vulnerability that could completely halt the network for an indeterminate amount of time. Since this is part of the cosmos EndBlocker loop, all validators would be stuck processing in an essentially infinite loop. The program will never break out of this because the gas subtracted from the gas_meter for the computation is miniscule in comparison to the computation. 


### Mitigation

Add appropriate gas metering to call_result_value proportional to the size of the data write
