# A single executor failed to reveal will cause data requests to timeout

### Summary

In case when an executor submits commit requests but fails to reveal them later due to software or network failure or any other reason will cause data requests to timeout

### Root Cause

During the commit phase, an existing implementation does not allow post commits anymore once [the replication factor is reached](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L44-L47):

```rust
    // error if reveal stage has started (replication factor reached)
    if dr.reveal_started() {
        return Err(ContractError::RevealStarted);
    }
```

From now on, [only reveal requests are accepted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/reveal_result.rs#L12-L15):

```rust
        // error if reveal phase for this DR has not started (i.e. replication factor is not met)
        if !dr.reveal_started() {
            return Err(ContractError::RevealNotStarted);
        }
```

However, the request can be transitioned to [the `Tallying` state](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/state/mod.rs#L79-L79) only when all committers successfully sent reveal requests:

```rust
pub fn reveal(store: &mut dyn Storage, dr_id: Hash, dr: DataRequest, current_height: u64) -> StdResult<()> {
    let status = if dr.is_tallying() {
        // We update the status of the request from Revealing to Tallying
        // So the chain can grab it and start tallying
        Some(DataRequestStatus::Tallying)
    } else {
        None
    };
    DATA_REQUESTS.update(store, dr_id, dr, status, current_height, false)?;

    Ok(())
}
``` 

This makes the execution process fragile as a single executor that fails will lead requests to timeout. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Data request is submitted, replication factor is 3
2. Executors A, B, and C sent commit messages, reveal phase concluded
3. Executors A and B sent reveal messages
4. Executor C failed
5. Request cannot be tallied and times out eventually

### Impact

1. Requests cannot finish the execution process
2. Filtering and tallying of data results phases are skipped

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce redundancy by allowing other executors to commit and reveal above the replication factor.
