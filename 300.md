# Requestor will be able to block identical requests from being processed

#### Summary
The deterministic generation of `requestId` will cause a **permanent denial of service** for requestors as a **malicious actor** will create requests with the same `requestId` and prevent identical requests from being processed.

#### Root Cause
In [SedaDataTypes.deriveRequestId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L122-L122), the `requestId` is derived purely from request inputs without any randomness or unique nonce. This design flaw allows a malicious user to preemptively create a request with a known `requestId`, permanently blocking other users from making the same request.

[SedaCoreV1.postResult](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L197-L197)

#### Internal Pre-conditions
1. A requestor submits a request with specific parameters.
2. The system derives a `requestId` based solely on those parameters.
3. The contract checks if a request with the same `requestId` already exists.
4. If the request exists, the new request is rejected.

#### External Pre-conditions
1. A malicious user submits a request with known data before another requestor can.
2. The attacker prevents the result from being posted by setting a requestor address that cannot receive ETH refunds.

#### Attack Path
1. **Attacker calls `postRequest` with specific inputs**, ensuring that the `requestId` is the same as a legitimate request expected from another user.
2. The system derives `requestId` from the inputs and stores the request.
3. **Attacker prevents the request from being resolved** by:
   - Using a contract as the requestor that does not accept ETH refunds.
   - This causes `postResult` to fail when attempting to return unused fees, blocking the request from completing.
4. **Legitimate users attempting to request the same data will be permanently blocked**, as the contract rejects duplicate `requestId`s.

#### Impact
Legitimate users **cannot create identical requests** if an attacker preemptively generates the same `requestId` and prevents resolution. This results in a **denial of service**, which could disrupt oracle functionality for critical data requests.

#### PoC

#### Mitigation
1. **Incorporate a unique nonce** (e.g., block number, timestamp, or user-specific nonce) when generating `requestId`.
3. **Ensure ETH refunds do not block result posting**.
