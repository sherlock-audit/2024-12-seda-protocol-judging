# The minimum and maximum values specified for `FilterStdDev` consesusFilterType are still huge, and can prevent consesus from being reached

### Summary

For `FilterStdDev` concensusFilterType, Requesters specify ranges where there data should not exceed to prevent excecutors from providing values which will prevent concensus from ever being reached but these values are still big and anyone can prevent concesus by providing data far from the required value.

[Mean calculation code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/filters.go#L224C2-L226C1)
```go
	n := big.NewInt(int64(len(nums)))
	mean := sum.Div(sum, n)
```

### Root Cause

- Having min and max ranges set defaultly by the system.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Default min and max ranges

### External Pre-conditions

- Excutor providing value very far from the desired range

### Attack Path

- A requestor requests for data from the protocal and provides the min and max ranges where this data can fall.
- A malicious executor, decides to provide a value that is very far from the possible value.
- Since its `FilterStdDev` concensusFilterType, the mean and MaxStdev calculated will not fit the genuine values.
- Concensus can not be reached and genuine data provided will be penalised by reducing on their reward. 

### Impact

Loss of funds by genuine executors and breaks the system by preventing concensus where it should be reached

### PoC

- Requestor sends a request with the system set range of 0 - Uint32.max(4,294,967,295), the data required is a percentage and must fall between 0 - 100. The data has a replication Factor of 5.
- Executor provide the data like 50, 54, 49, 50 and a malicious executor sets his data to Uint32.max(4,294,967,295).
- The stdev calculated will  be `1,920,767,700` and mean of `4,294,967,498`
- The genuine first 4 values will not be able to fit the stdev and will be labelled as outliers.

### Mitigation

Consider allowing requestors to set their own ranges of required values.
