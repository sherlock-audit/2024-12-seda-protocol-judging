# Attacker will stael user asset

### Summary

The function `withdraw.execute()` does not verify that the asset owner is `info.sender`, and Seda Chain's mempool is public. Therefore, an attacker can monitor transactions in the mempool, obtain the corresponding proof value of the withdrawal message, and frontrun the transaction to steal user assets.

### Root Cause

The function `withdraw.execute()` does not verify `info.sender` and struct `withdraw::Execute` not include `receiver`.
