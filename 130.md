# Signature Replay Attack in Secp256k1ProverV1

### Summary

validators sign a batch ID, and if enough signatures are collected, the batch is posted. However, signatures from an old batch could be reused to authorize a new batch, leading to a replay attack.

How This Attack Works in  Contract
A validator signs a batch at height N:


bytes32 batchId = SedaDataTypes.deriveBatchId(newBatch);

This batch ID is derived only from batch data (e.g., resultsRoot, validatorsRoot).
The validator’s signature is created off-chain for this specific batch ID.
The signature is broadcasted on-chain in postBatch():


if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
    revert InvalidSignature();
}

Attack Scenario:

An attacker reuses old valid signatures from batch N.
They construct a malicious batch at N+1 with the same batch ID.

They call postBatch(), passing the old signatures, tricking the contract into accepting a fraudulent batch.
How to Prevent Signature Replay

To prevent signature reuse, the signed message must be unique for each batch submission. The best way to do this is to include:

 Batch height (batchHeight) – ensures signatures are unique per batch.
 Sender’s address (msg.sender) – prevents front-running attacks.

### Mitigation

 Modify _verifySignature() to Include Batch Height and Sender
Modify _verifySignature() to ensure signatures are unique for each batch and sender:


function _verifySignature(
    bytes32 batchId,
    bytes calldata signature,
    address signer,
    uint64 batchHeight,
    address sender
) internal pure returns (bool) {
    // Create a unique message that prevents replay attacks
    bytes32 uniqueMessage = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(batchId, batchHeight, sender));

    // Ensure the signature is valid
    return ECDSA.recover(uniqueMessage, signature) == signer;
}

Fix: Update postBatch() to Pass Additional Parameters

Modify the postBatch() function to pass newBatch.batchHeight and msg.sender when verifying signatures:


if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer, newBatch.batchHeight, msg.sender)) {
    revert InvalidSignature();
}

Batch height (batchHeight) ensures each batch is unique.

Even if an attacker reuses a signature, the batch height in the message will not match the new batch height.
The signature will fail verification.
