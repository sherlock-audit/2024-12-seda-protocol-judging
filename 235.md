# Anyone can post a request with `gasPrice` of 0 to cause SEDA chain to halt

### Summary

There are no validations preventing a data request's `gasPrice` to be zero. When the SEDA Chain tallies data requests, it uses `gasPrice`
as a divisor in one of its gas calculations. A zero `gasPrice` leads to a division-by-zero that crashes all validator nodes.

### Root Cause

- In SEDA Chain's Core contract, no validation is done on the value of the `gasPrice` when [posting a request](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L9-L102).
- In SEDA Chain's Tally module, it uses `gasPrice` as the [divisor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L87) when metering the gas for proxies.
```golang
gasUsedPerExecInt := proxyConfig.Fee.Amount.Quo(gasMeter.GasPrice())
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker can [post](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L9) a valid request with `gasPrice` of 0, `replicationFactor` of 1, and no filters.
2. Once the request has been commit-revealed by a validator, whether maliciously or unwittingly, it will be processed by the SEDA Chain's
Tally module [`Endblock()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L22-L41).
3. Since no filtering is applied, there will be no filtering errors and it attempts to [meter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L232) the gas for the proxies. The node will then panic and crash.
4. Every validator node will process this data request since it has a "Tallying" status and they will all crash until the issue is resolved. 

### Impact

This causes all validator nodes to crash indefinitely, leading to a Chain halt.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider validating that the `gasPrice` is non-zero before using it as a divisor or checking that `gasPrice` is a minimum non-zero value.
