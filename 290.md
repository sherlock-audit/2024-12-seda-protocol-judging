# Insufficient Fee Validation in `increaseFees` Function

**Summary**

The `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees` function does not enforce validation to ensure that the additional fees provided are greater than existing fees. This allows users to submit zero-value or lower-value updates, leading to potential inconsistencies and unintended financial behavior.

**Impact**

- The function does not prevent redundant or unnecessary transactions that consume gas without meaningfully updating fee values.

- A malicious actor could repeatedly call `increaseFees` with zero or minimal fees to bloat transaction history, increasing storage costs and reducing efficiency.

**Recommended Mitigation**

Implement a validation check to ensure that the new fees are greater than the existing fees

```javascript
if (
    additionalRequestFee < details.requestFee ||
    additionalResultFee < details.resultFee ||
    additionalBatchFee < details.batchFee
) {
    revert("New fees must be greater than or equal to previous fees");
}
```
