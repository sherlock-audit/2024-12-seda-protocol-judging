# Malicious `batchSender` can reject ethers so that only he can claim reward

### Summary

When `postResult` sends ethers to `batchSender` if `batchSender` checks `tx.origin` and it is not his wallet, he can reject that and he can allow only his wallet.
Malicious `batchSender` can get reward `batchFee` + `resultFee`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L187-L187

It sends `batchFee` to `batchSender` directly and he can reject when `tx.origin` is not him.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. `batchSender` submits `batch`.
2. A user calls `postResult` for `resultFee`.
3. `batchSender` reject to receive ether.
4. User can't claim `resultFee`.

### Impact

Only `batchSender` can calls `postResult` and he can get `batchFee` and `resultFee`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement claim mechanism or send WETH instead of ether.
