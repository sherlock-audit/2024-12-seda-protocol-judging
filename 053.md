# Data requests queue can be DoS'ed

### Summary

Posting data requests on the SEDA chain is permissionless and does not incur fees. This can be exploited by creating thousands of dummy and cheap data requests that will never be executed by executors but, once expire, they will bloat the processing queue.

### Root Cause


To post a data request, a caller only needs to pay enough tokens to [cover gas](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L32-L39) for the request processing:


```rust
        let required = (Uint128::from(self.posted_dr.exec_gas_limit) + Uint128::from(self.posted_dr.tally_gas_limit))
            .checked_mul(self.posted_dr.gas_price)?;
        if funds < required {
            return Err(ContractError::InsufficientFunds(
                required,
                get_attached_funds(&info.funds, &token)?,
            ));
        };
```

However, `exec_gas_limit`, `tally_gas_limit`, and `gas_price` are input parameters specified by the caller hence they can be set low to result in charges of 1 or a few units of `aseda` tokens.

Such results will likely be ignored by executors as the rewards are negligent, however, they will be included in the processing ([tallying](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/state/data_requests_map.rs#L209-L224)) after the timeout period passed:



```rust
    pub fn expire_data_requests(&self, store: &mut dyn Storage, current_height: u64) -> StdResult<Vec<String>> {
        // remove them from the timeouts and return the hashes
        let drs_to_update_to_tally = self.timeouts.remove_by_timeout_height(store, current_height)?;

        drs_to_update_to_tally
            .into_iter()
            .map(|hash| {
                // get the dr itself
                let dr = self.get(store, &hash)?;
                // update it to tallying
@>              self.update(store, hash, dr, Some(DataRequestStatus::Tallying), current_height, true)?;
                Ok(hash.to_hex())
            })
            .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    }
```

By creating thousands of such data requests an attacker can bloat a processing queue and prevent legitimate requests from processing in time. As can be seen from the following code snippet, only a limited set of data requests can be handled in a block: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L53-L57

It is worth noting that even a negligible amount paid by the attacker for data request processing will be refunded to them after the processing pipeline is completed.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates 1000s of data requests
2. All these requests time out
3. x/tally module processes only a single page limited to `params.MaxTalliesPerBlock` potentially consisting of the attacker's fake requests only.


### Impact

1. Chain slowdown
2. Legitimate requests time out

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a data request fee or make a data request call permissioned to the whitelisted solvers
