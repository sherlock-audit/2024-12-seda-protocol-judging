# Unstaking executor may cause replication factor be greater than number of executors

### Summary

Executors can unstake at any time causing existing data requests that use a replication factor equal to the number of executors to never be fulfilled.

### Root Cause

In [`post_request.rs:16-19`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L16-L19) a data request can be posted with the replication factor being equal to any value between 1 and the number of stakers:

```rust
        let stakers_length = STAKERS.len(deps.storage)?;
        if self.posted_dr.replication_factor as u32 > stakers_length {
            return Err(ContractError::DataRequestReplicationFactorTooHigh(stakers_length));
        }
```


This creates a point of failure if any executor unstakes during request processing, causing data requests to remain in limbo until they time out.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A request is present with `replication_factor` equal to the number of stakers

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A request posted with `replication_factor` equal to the number of stakers
2. One executor unstakes while the request is in the commit (or reveal) state
3. Request cannot be fulfilled, and times out eventually

### Impact

Failed/Timed out requests due to a lack of executors to fulfill them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce an unbonding period for executors and do not allow them to submit requests with a replication factor greater than `total_number_executors - unbonding_number_executors`.
