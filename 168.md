# EndBlock will silently discard errors which could lead to state inconsistencies

### Summary

The error swallowing in `EndBlock` will cause state inconsistencies for fee updates as errors are silently discarded, allowing the protocol to continue with potentially invalid state.

### Root Cause

In `seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/abci.go:9-15` 'https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/abci.go#L9-L15' the `EndBlock` function uses a defer block that sets `err = nil` after logging, effectively swallowing all errors from fee update processing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to process fee updates during block end.
2. An error needs to occur during fee update processing (e.g. invalid fee amount).

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions required.

### Attack Path

        1. Attacker submits an invalid fee update that would normally cause an error.
        2. During `EndBlock`, the fee update processing encounters the error.
        3. The error is logged but then set to nil in the defer block.
        4. The block continues processing as if no error occurred.
        5. The protocol state becomes inconsistent with the intended fee updates.


### Impact

The protocol suffers from potential state inconsistencies as fee updates may fail silently. This could lead to incorrect fee calculations and economic imbalances in the system.

### PoC

  ```go
        func TestEndBlockErrorSwallowing(t *testing.T) {
            ctx := sdk.NewContext(...)
            k := NewKeeper(...)
            
            // Inject a failing fee update
            k.SetFeeUpdate(ctx, pubkey, invalidFeeAmount)
            
            // EndBlock will return nil even though processing failed
            err := k.EndBlock(ctx)
            require.Nil(t, err)
            
            // State remains unchanged when it should have errored
            config := k.GetDataProxyConfig(ctx, pubkey)
            require.Equal(t, oldFeeAmount, config.Fee)
        }
```
       

### Mitigation

Remove the `err = nil` line from the defer block and allow errors to propagate:
```go
        func (k *Keeper) EndBlock(ctx sdk.Context) (err error) {
            defer func() {
                if r := recover(); r != nil {
                    k.Logger(ctx).Error("recovered from panic in data-proxy EndBlock", "err", r)
                    err = fmt.Errorf("panic in EndBlock: %v", r)
                }
                if err != nil {
                    k.Logger(ctx).Error("error in data-proxy EndBlock", "err", err)
                    // Remove err = nil to allow error propagation
                }
            }()
            return k.ProcessFeeUpdates(ctx)
        }
```
