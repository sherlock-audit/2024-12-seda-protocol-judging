# SEDA Protocol Vulnerability: Malicious Validators Can Hijack New Validator Requests

### Summary
A security weakness has been discovered in the SEDA protocol that allows a malicious validator to intercept and preempt genuine `CreateSEDAValidator` requests from new validators. This flaw enables an attacker to duplicate a transaction from the mempool, potentially locking the new validator's deposit indefinitely.

### Finding Description
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/staking/keeper/msg_server.go#L48

In the standard Cosmos implementation, the `createValidator` operation is designed to fail if a public key is already linked to an existing validator. This safeguard ensures that no two validators share the same key. However, the SEDA protocol’s custom `CreateSEDAValidator` function wraps the base Cosmos message without verifying the true ownership of the provided public key. This omission permits an attacker to exploit the system by observing pending requests and then re-submitting a duplicate request with the same public key.

### Attack Scenario
Consider a scenario where a legitimate validator (for instance, "Alice") submits a creation request. A malicious actor (hypothetically "Bob") monitoring the mempool can detect this transaction and immediately submit an identical request with the same public key. Although the SEDA implementation might utilize a different internal identifier (like the validator’s private address file) for some operations, the underlying Cosmos SDK still processes the public key, leaving the system vulnerable to this form of front-running.

### Recommendations
To counter this risk, the following measures are advised:

- **Verify Ownership of Public Keys**: Introduce strict checks to confirm that the public key in a validator creation request is legitimately controlled by the requestor.
- **Maintain a Registry of Active Public Keys**: Develop and enforce a system to record all registered public keys. Before processing any new request, the system should check this registry to ensure no duplication, thus preventing conflicts and refunding the user in case of an error.
- **Monitor Mempool Activity**: Implement mechanisms to track public keys present in the mempool. This would stop the submission of multiple validator creation requests using the same public key concurrently.
