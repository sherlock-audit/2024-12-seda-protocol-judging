# `Secp256k1ProverV1` is vulnerable to re-org incidents

### Summary
A reorg can change the ordering of transactions, transactions which are dropped as a result of the reorg enter the public mempool again to be picked up by nodes. In result, a batch with a **higher** batch height might be included in the new block before a batch with a lower height. Since `postBatch` only accepts batches with strictly increasing heights, any batch that has a lower height will be rejected, and its corresponding results will never be posted.
Re-orgs might also prevent new batch submissions by changing the latest validators root.

### Root Cause
The `postBatch` function enforces that each new batch must have a strictly greater batch height than the last accepted batch:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L97-L99
```solidity
    function postBatch(
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures,
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
        Secp256k1ProverStorage storage s = _storageV1();
        // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
        if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
For example, suppose batch number 8 and batch number 9 are included in Ethereum blocks 1000 and 1001, a reorg could reorder the transactions so that batch 9 is confirmed before batch 8. As a result, batch 8 would be rejected because it has a lower batch height than the last accepted batch, and its results would never be posted.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- Contract not being in `paused` state

### External Pre-conditions
- A reorg happens
- Due to transaction re-ordering, the batch with higher number included before batches with lower number (or might even not picked up by nodes again)

### Attack Path
n/a

### Impact
1- Transaction Dropping and Reordering:
In a reorg, some transactions that were previously included in a block can be dropped or delayed. This means that newer batches might be confirmed first in the new canonical chain, while older ones with lower heights are left out and ultimately cannot be submitted.

2- Validators root inconsistencies:
If the reorg causes dropped transactions such that the new chain state does not include the new batch submissions, the contract state (including the `lastValidatorsRoot`) might revert to a previous version. This previous validators root could contain validators who are no longer active or omit validators who are currently active, which might result in preventing subsequent batch submissions. (because new validators are not included in the old root)

### PoC
n/a

### Mitigation
Enforce that new batches must have a batch height exactly one more than the previous batch. This strict sequential ordering ensures that even if some batches are dropped due to a reorg, off-chain services can detect and recover them before the contract state is **permanently** updated in an unrevertable manner:
```solidity
    function postBatch(
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures,
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
        Secp256k1ProverStorage storage s = _storageV1();
        // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
        if (newBatch.batchHeight != s.lastBatchHeight + 1) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
