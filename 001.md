# `Secp256k1ProverV1`.`postBatch` doesn't check duplication of signers

### Summary

Missing duplication check of signers can cause malicious batcher can post invalid Batch and it can be proven.
Malicious batcher can post batch with array of same signature and `ValidatorProof` but protocol doesn't check duplication.
It breaks consensus mechanism and this is very critical problem.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L110-L120

Malicious batcher can post batch with several same signature and `ValidatorProof` but protocol didn't check duplication and it can be passed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Malicious batcher gets one valid signature and valid `ValidatorProof` can be bypassed here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L112-L118
2. Malicious batcher posts batch with duplicated array of above data.
3. Protocol doesn't check duplication and it breaks consensus mechanism.


### Impact

Invalid batched are recorded bypassing consensus mechanism.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement duplication checking mechanism about signers.
