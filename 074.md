# Malicious batch poster can deny data results posting

### Summary

An attacker may post batches using a contract that does not accept ETH payments, creating a DoS during result posting.

### Root Cause

In [`SedaCoreV1.sol:187`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L187) batch fee is intended to be sent to the `batchSender`:

```solidity
      // Send batch fee to batch sender
@>    _transferFee(batchSender, requestDetails.batchFee); // @audit this may revert
      emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, batchSender, requestDetails.batchFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.BATCH);
```

where `batchSender` is an address that posted the batch:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L131

Knowing that an attacker may post a batch via a smart contract that reverts on ETH transfers makes result posting impossible. This attack can be repeated indefinitely at a low cost, as the attacker only loses gas fees, which are minimal on L2 networks.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker posts data result batch using a malicious contract
2. A solver nodes attempt to post data results for that batch however transactions revert because batch fee transfers fail

### Impact

The inability to post data results can be detrimental to time-sensitive data requestors. An attacker will lose only gas fees which would be low on L2.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use pull-over-push pattern for fee distribution.
