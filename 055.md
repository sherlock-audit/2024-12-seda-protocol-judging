# Merkle tree could be built incorrectly

### Summary

The Merkle tree could be built incorrectly when the number of leaves or nodes is not even.

### Root Cause

In ['app/utils/merkle.go'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/merkle.go#L48-L64), the algorithm constructs the Merkle tree using a single 1-dimensional array where leaves are stored at the tail and the tree root is at the head (i.e. at the index 0):

```rust
// buildTree builds and returns a merkle tree from the given leaves.
// The tree root is placed at the first index. If no leaves are
// provided, the returned tree is a single node with an empty hash.
func buildTree(sha hash.Hash, leaves [][]byte) [][]byte {
	if len(leaves) == 0 {
		return [][]byte{emptyHash(sha)}
	}

	tree := make([][]byte, 2*len(leaves)-1)
	for i, leaf := range leaves {
		tree[len(tree)-1-i] = leaf
	}
	for i := len(tree) - 1 - len(leaves); i >= 0; i-- {
		tree[i] = parentHash(sha, tree[2*i+1], tree[2*i+2])
	}
	return tree
}
```

However, this implementation does not account for a non-even number of leaves or nodes at any level trying to hash the last unpaired element with the element of the next (lower) level.

1. Consider an example where we need to construct a Merkle tree from 5 leaves.

```bash
leaves: 5 elements
tree length is 2*5 - 1 = 9
```
2. Put leaves at the tail the array:

```bash
tree[8] = leaf[0]
tree[7] = leaf[1]
tree[6] = leaf[2]
tree[5] = leaf[3]
tree[4] = leaf[4]
```
3. Iterate from the 3rd element to the 0th and hash each pair:

```bash
tree[3] = hash(tree[7], tree[8])
tree[2] = hash(tree[5], tree[6])
tree[1] = hash(tree[3], tree[4]) <@ here, a leaf (tree[4]) is hashed with the node of the next level (tree[3])
tree[0] = hash(tree[1], tree[2])
```

The discrepancy made at the last step (hashing elements (tree[3], tree[4] together) will lead to non-standard Merkle trees produced, which may not be reconstructable in the same way by other actors thus proof will not be verifiable.

It is worth noting that a full Merkle tree is not stored for later retrieval by other network participants but is expected to be reconstructed on their side to produce verifiable proofs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The number of leaves or nodes is not even (meaning any number except a power of 2 satisfies this condition).

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

See a detailed example in the "Root Cause" section

### Impact

Non-standard Merkle tree may lead to non-verifiable proofs if other participants do not use a same way of hashing unpaired nodes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Hash unpaired node with itself or zero hash as a standard way to produce Merkle trees.
