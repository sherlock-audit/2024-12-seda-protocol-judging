# Tally VM startup costs not charged early enough

### Summary

The gas for activating the WASM VM is not charged early enough to prevent DoS attacks.

### Root Cause

In [`seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/runtime.rs#L85-L93`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/runtime.rs#L85-L93), the gas is charged for starting up VM based on the formula `(GAS_PER_BYTE * args_bytes_total as u64) + GAS_STARTUP` where `GAS_PER_BYTE` = `10_000` and  `GAS_STARTUP` = `5_000_000_000_000`.

```golang
        let args_bytes_total = call_data.args.iter().fold(0, |acc, v| acc + v.len());
        // Gas startup costs (for spinning up the VM)
        let gas_cost = (GAS_PER_BYTE * args_bytes_total as u64) + GAS_STARTUP;

        if gas_cost < gas_limit {
            set_remaining_points(&mut context.wasm_store, &wasmer_instance, gas_limit - gas_cost);
        } else {
            set_remaining_points(&mut context.wasm_store, &wasmer_instance, 0);
        }
```

However, this occurs quite late in the process, right before the tally function call, after several computationally expensive operations - such as creating the runtime, instantiating the environment and module, and allocating memory - have already been executed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_None_

### External Pre-conditions

_None_

### Attack Path

An attacker can post data requests with a gas limit sufficient for the data request and filtering phases but leaving zero or nearly zero gas for the tallying phase. This triggers the `internal_run_vm()` function to spin up the VM completely, only to stop execution immediately when the first metered operation is executed due to gas exhaustion. This makes such attacks cheaper than expected.

### Impact

DoS attack, chain slowdown.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not start tally phase execution if the remaining gas is not enough for the VM spin-up.
