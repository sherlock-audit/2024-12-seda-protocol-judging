# Malicious block proposer can withhold batch signatures to manipulate consensus

### Summary

The missing verification of the vote number in `ProcessProposalHandler` enables the active block proposer to withhold any signatures and makes batch consensus fail.

### Root Cause

In the `handlers.go` `PrepareProposalHandler()` function an active block proposer [collects all vote extensions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L198) (batch signatures) and [injects them in the block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L222-L226). 

Next, upon receiving the proposed block, each active chain validator [processes the injected votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L261-L270) in `ProcessProposalHandler()` by verifying the batch signatures.

It is worth noting that signature verification is limited to only validating the signature itself and ensuring a validator from the active validation set signed it.

If an active block proposer decides to manipulate votes by withholding any number of signatures, it will go unnoticed and be accepted by other validators. This creates an opportunity for exploitation, where the batch signing could fail to meet the 66% consensus threshold, preventing the batch from being delivered to the target chain.

```golang
@>	injection, err = json.Marshal(req.LocalLastCommit) // @audit this can be manipulated
	if err != nil {
		h.logger.Error("failed to marshal extended votes", "err", err)
		return nil, err
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Validators post their signatures (as vote extension) at block H via `ExtendVoteHandler()`.
2. Validators verify each other signatures via `VerifyVoteExtensionHandler()`.
3. Malicious block proposer manipulates (removes) signatures at block H+1 at `PrepareProposalHandler()` so that consensus is not reached.
4. Validators successfully verify a proposal in `ProcessProposalHandler()`.
5. Finally, block signatures will be persisted in a store in `PreBlocker()`.
6. If a solver node tries to deliver such a batch to the EVM chain, it will revert as the consensus threshold is not met.

### Impact

Inability to deliver batch results on time could be critical, especially in cases such as price oracles, where timely data is essential.
