# In the batching module, requests are marked as batched even if `ConstructBatch` faild to construcut validators root at due to an error inside `ConstructValidatorTree`

### Summary
Requests might be marked as "batched" even if an error occurs within `ConstructValidatorTree` (for example, due to a misconfigured validators set). This means that even though batching is skipped for the current block, some results are marked as batched, preventing their inclusion in future batches.

### Root Cause
The batching module’s endblocker calls `ConstructBatch`, which is responsible for computing both the results root and the validators root and then returning a new batch for on-chain submission. Within `ConstructBatch`, the function `ConstructDataResultTree` is called to calculate the results root and mark the corresponding results as "batched"—indicating that they have been successfully included in a batch:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L81
```go
        //@audit returns dataRoot (resultsRoot) and dataEntries (array containing results) and marks them as batched
	dataEntries, dataRoot, err := k.ConstructDataResultTree(ctx, newBatchNum)
	if err != nil {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
```
In `ConstructDataResultTree`, the results are marked as `batched`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L145
```go
                //@audit mark these results as batched
		err = k.MarkDataResultAsBatched(ctx, res, newBatchNum)
		if err != nil {
			return types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
		}
```
After marking the results, the batching process proceeds to construct the validators root by calling `ConstructValidatorTree`:
```go
	// Compute validator tree root.
	valEntries, valRoot, err := k.ConstructValidatorTree(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
```
If an error occurs during the execution of `ConstructValidatorTree`, `ConstructBatch` returns an error and skips the batching process entirely:
```go
	batch, dataEntries, valEntries, err := k.ConstructBatch(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		if errors.Is(err, types.ErrNoBatchingUpdate) {
			k.Logger(ctx).Info("skip batch creation", "height", ctx.BlockHeight())
			return nil
		}
                //@audit skip this batching
		return err
	}
```
The critical flaw is that the results have already been marked as batched by `ConstructDataResultTree` before the call to `ConstructValidatorTree`. Therefore, if an error in `ConstructValidatorTree` prevents a valid batch from being constructed, those results remain marked as batched. In subsequent batching rounds, the function `GetDataResults` retrieves only results that have not been marked as batched, which means these results will be permanently excluded from future batches.
```go
func (k Keeper) ConstructDataResultTree(ctx sdk.Context, newBatchNum uint64) (types.DataResultTreeEntries, []byte, error) {
        //@audit only get results which are not batched
	dataResults, err := k.GetDataResults(ctx, false)
	if err != nil {
		return types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

An error occurring within `ConstructValidatorTree` can result from:
- **Issues with calculating the total voting power** [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L160-L163)
- **Problems decompressing the validators’ public key** [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L177-L181)
- **Errors retrieving the uncompressed validator key** [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L171-L176)

### Impact
- Results that are incorrectly marked as batched will not be included in future batches.
- Users will not receive their results and may be forced to withdraw their funds.
- Solvers, the overlay network, and other participants will have expended resources for work that ultimately yields no benefit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
To resolve this issue, modify the order of operations in the batching process by calling `ConstructValidatorTree` before `ConstructDataResultTree`. This ensures that results are only marked as batched if the entire batching process completes successfully. For example:
```go
	// First, Compute validator tree root.
	valEntries, valRoot, err := k.ConstructValidatorTree(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
	valRootHex := hex.EncodeToString(valRoot)

        // Then calculate resuts and mark them as batched
	dataEntries, dataRoot, err := k.ConstructDataResultTree(ctx, newBatchNum)
	if err != nil {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
	latestDataRoot, err := hex.DecodeString(latestDataRootHex)
	if err != nil {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
	superRoot := utils.RootFromLeaves([][]byte{latestDataRoot, dataRoot})
```
