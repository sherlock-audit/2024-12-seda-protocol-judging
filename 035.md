# Insufficient Timestamp Validation

### Summary

In `SedaCoreV1.sol` the check assumes `result.blockTimestamp` and `block.timestamp` are trustworthy, but it’s provided by the caller and only compared to the request’s timestamp. A malicious prover could submit manipulated timestamps, bypassing this check and enabling  invalid results.

### Root Cause

Miners choose the `block.timestamp` when they mine a block, so they can adjust it slightly to their advantage.
relying only on the caller ro provide `block.timestamp` puts the integrity of the if  statement in danger.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `SedaCoreV1.sol` needs to ask the `block.timestamp` from a untrustworthy provider.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The `block.timestamp`'s provider is an untrustworthy provider.

### Attack Path

`SedaCoreV1.sol` asks the `block.timestamp` from a untrustworthy provider and that provider adjusts it to their advantage.

### Impact

Undermines result integrity, potentially allowing fraudulent data to be posted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use an External Oracle like Chainlink to verify the `block.timestamp`
