# provingMetaData is declared but never initialized

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L104C2-L123C4

provingMetaData is declared but never initialized. The hashing branch will never execute, and provingMetaDataHash will always be a zero-filled byte array.

The code intended to do actual cryptographic hashing of some proving metadata, but this never happens.
Instead, a zero-filled hash is always used, which will have security implications since hashes should generally not be predictable.
The batch always stores an empty ProvingMetadata field, which is missing important data that should have been included.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L104C2-L123C4

The variable provingMetaData is declared as a zero-length slice (var provingMetaData, provingMetaDataHash []byte).
Immediately after declaration, the code checks if len(provingMetaData) == 0, which will always be true because provingMetaData was just initialized as an empty slice.
This means the first branch of the if-statement will always execute, setting provingMetaDataHash = make([]byte, 32) - a 32-byte array of zeros.
The else branch (hasher := sha3.NewLegacyKeccak256()...) will never execute because the condition to enter it is never met.
Later, this zero-filled hash is used in calculating the batch ID:
batchID := types.ComputeBatchID(newBatchNum, ctx.BlockHeight(), valRoot, superRoot, provingMetaDataHash)

Finally, the uninitialized provingMetaData is stored in the batch:
`return types.Batch{
    // other fields...
    ProvingMetadata: provingMetaData,
}`

### Impact

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L104C2-L123C4

This is a security issue because cryptographic processes rely on proper hashing. Using a predictable zero hash instead of a properly generated hash will undermine the security properties of the system.
