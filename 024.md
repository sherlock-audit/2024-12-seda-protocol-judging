# Unverified Ecrecover Return Value Validity

Unverified Ecrecover Return Value Validity
Summary

The validity of the return value from the crypto.Ecrecover function is not verified, which may lead to null pointer exceptions or malicious signature bypassing verification.

Vulnerability Detail

In the verifyBatchSignatures function, the public key returned by crypto.Ecrecover is not checked for being null or correctly formatted, and is directly used in subsequent logic. Maliciously constructed signatures may cause null pointer exceptions or bypass verification logic.

Impact

An attacker can bypass verification by constructing malicious signatures, leading to unauthorized signatures being accepted and compromising system security.

Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L383
sigPubKey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65])
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// sigPubKey validity is not verified
Tool Used

Manual Review

Recommendation

After crypto.Ecrecover returns, add a check for the validity of sigPubKey, for example:


if sigPubKey == nil || len(sigPubKey) != 65 {
    return ErrInvalidPublicKey
}
