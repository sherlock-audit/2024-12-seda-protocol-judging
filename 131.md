# Potential Front-Running in postBatch()

### Summary

How the Attack Works

A validator submits a batch using postBatch() with valid signatures and proofs.
The transaction is pending in the mempool.
A malicious actor observes the transaction and extracts:
newBatch (batch data)
signatures
validatorProofs

The attacker submits the same data but with a higher gas fee.
Their transaction gets processed first, making the original transaction fail (since the batch is already posted).
The attacker claims credit for posting the batch.

Impact of the Attack

Validators lose expected rewards

If the contract provides incentives for batch submission, the attacker steals the reward meant for the original submitter.
DOS Attack Against Honest Validators
The attacker can consistently front-run transactions to prevent the original validator from successfully posting batches.
Loss of Gas Fees.
The original sender loses ETH due to failed transactions.

### Mitigation

 Include msg.sender in the Signed Message
Currently, validators sign only the batch ID:

batchId = SedaDataTypes.deriveBatchId(newBatch);
This means anyone can take the batch ID and submit it.

 Fix: Modify _verifySignature() to Include msg.sender
By making validators sign a message that includes msg.sender, only the original sender can post the batch.


function _verifySignature(
    bytes32 batchId,
    bytes calldata signature,
    address signer,
    uint64 batchHeight,
    address sender
) internal pure returns (bool) {
    // Create a unique message that includes the sender
    bytes32 uniqueMessage = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(batchId, batchHeight, sender));

    // Ensure the signature is valid
    return ECDSA.recover(uniqueMessage, signature) == signer;
}

Then, update postBatch():


if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer, newBatch.batchHeight, msg.sender)) {
    revert InvalidSignature();
}
