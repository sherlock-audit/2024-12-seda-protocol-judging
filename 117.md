# Unrestricted Fee Escalation




##  Summary
The `SedaCoreV1` contract allow any Ethereum account to add fees to existing data requests through the `increaseFees()` regardless of whether they created the original request. This violate the protocol ownership model and enable financial griefing attack.



## **Vulnerability Details**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206--L227


The vulnerability is in increaseFees function which allow any Ethereum account to arbitrarily increase fees for any existing data request.
 here's the flow :
Any user call 'increaseFees' with a valid requestId and ETH matching the fee increases.
The contract retrieves the request's details (creator address, existing fees) from storage using the requestId but there's no verification that msg.sender match the requestor address stored for that requestId 
```solidity
function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }

        RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
        if (details.timestamp == 0) {
            revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        }

        details.requestFee += additionalRequestFee;
        details.resultFee += additionalResultFee;
        details.batchFee += additionalBatchFee;

        emit FeesIncreased(requestId, additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee);
    }
```

Then the contract add the new fees to the requestâ€™s existing fees regardless of who initiated the transaction.

This code
```solidity
if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
```
only validate ETH amounts not who is sending them and even with this check anyone can call increaseFees for any request ID and modify its fees as long as they send matching ETH

## **Proof of Concept**

1. James Legitimate Request:

James create a data request (ID 123) with reasonable fees:

Request Fee: 1 ETH

Result Fee: 0.5 ETH

Batch Fee: 0.2 ETH

As it reflect his budget and expected costs for the service.

2. Dan unauthorized Interference:

Dan notice the Request 123 and decide to exploit the vulnerability.
He call the increaseFees function with:

```solidity
increaseFees(
    requestId: 123,
    additionalRequestFee: 100 ETH,  // 100x James original fee
    additionalResultFee: 50 ETH,    // 100x increase
    additionalBatchFee: 20 ETH      // 100x increase
)
```
Dan sends 170 ETH to the contract (100 + 50 + 20).

3. The contract will accept the payment without verifying if Dan owns Request 123 and then update the fees:

New Request Fee: 1 ETH + 100 ETH = 101 ETH

New Result Fee: 0.5 ETH + 50 ETH = 50.5 ETH

New Batch Fee: 0.2 ETH + 20 ETH = 20.2 ETH

4. so the consequences for James is that :

His request now costs 101x more than intended so he either pays the inflated fees or cancels the request losing time and gas costs.

## **Impact**

                           
- Financial griefing as Attackers can make requests as expensive by inflating fees then the egitimate users lose control over their request's financial parameters   

- solvers  will prioritize artificially high fee request 
  
 

## **Recommendation**
  
verify the ownership in the  `increaseFees()`:

```solidity
function increaseFees(......) external payable {
  
    
   // Validate ownership
    if (msg.sender != requestOwner) revert Unauthorized();
    
    // Then update fees...
}
```
