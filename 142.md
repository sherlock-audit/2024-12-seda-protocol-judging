# A malicious validator can frontrun and permanently DOS one new validator

## Description

Currently, a malicious validator actor with acess to the mempool can front run any new validators' CreateSEDAValidator request to lock new validator's deposit permanently.

According to cosmos documentation [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.52/build/modules/staking#msgcreatevalidator), the createValidator msg will fail when there is a public key already registered with another validator.
> This message is expected to fail if:
> * another validator with this pubkey is already registered

The CreateSEDAValidator (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/staking/keeper/msg_server.go#L48) wraps around the base cosmos sdk message but there is no check to guide against  using a public key belonging to another validator 

Therefore Dr Strange (the malicious actor) can see Dormammu's request in the mempool, create another request with same public key (since there is no validation to check if this is actually his public key)

Although it seems as though the SEDA side of thing does not actually use the public key when saving the SEDApubkey Index, but uses the validator private address file, the fact that the same public key still gets sent to the original cosmos sdk create validator function means that the front running is still possible

## Recommendation

Three possible ways this can be mitigated:

*  Implement checks to ensure that the validator is the actual owner of the pubkey
* Keep track of registered pubkey (this is being done) and fail before calling cosmos with refund (user cannot create validator but does not lose funds)
* Keep track of pubkeys in mempool and ensure anotehr createvalidor message cannot be called with any of those pubKeys
