# Executors/Proxies can game the rewards system by using a pubkey that will be sorted first

### Summary

The reveals and proxy pubkeys are sorted in ascending order every time data requests are filtered and tallied. The same ordering is used when metering gas for Proxies and Executors. Proxies and Executors that are sorted first will be prioritized for rewards distribution.

### Root Cause

In [`FilterAndTally():185-197`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L185-L197), the `reveals` are sorted in ascending order by their executor's key while the `ProxyPubkeys` of each reveal are also sorted in ascending order.

```golang
  keys := make([]string, len(req.Reveals))
  i := 0
  for k := range req.Reveals {
    keys[i] = k
    i++
  }
  sort.Strings(keys)

  reveals := make([]types.RevealBody, len(req.Reveals))
  for i, k := range keys {
    reveals[i] = req.Reveals[k]
    sort.Strings(reveals[i].ProxyPubKeys)
  }
```

When [metering](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L68-L97) gas for proxies, the proxies are allocated gas in the same order until there is no remaining execution gas. Proxies with pubkeys that are ordered first will be prioritized.

The same behavior applies when [metering](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L135-L144) gas for executors.

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. A Proxy/Executor will generate and use public keys that will be ordered first when sorted.
2. When gas rewards are allocated and distributed, they will always be prioritized over others.


### Impact

The rewards system can be gamed so that certain Executors/Proxies will always be prioritized for rewards even when all participating proxies/executors provide the same value.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider randomizing the order of the executors' and proxies' public keys when allocating their rewards.
