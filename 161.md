# Potential Fee Overpayment Due to Failed Transfers in postResult

### Summary

In the `SedaCoreV1` contract, the `postResult` function includes multiple transfer operations to distribute different types of fees. If any of these transfers fail, some transger have already been made, some not. Cause not single transfer function,in order to transfer other fees, need call `postResult`  again, this could lead to fee transfer repeatlly.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is that no single function for charge each fee. Once a transfer fails causing need call `postResult` again, the system cannot determine which fees have already been paid and which have not.

```solidity

// Multiple subsequent transfer operations...
if (requestDetails.requestFee > 0) {
    // ...
    _transferFee(payableAddress, submitterFee); // May fail
}

if (requestDetails.resultFee > 0) {
    _transferFee(msg.sender, requestDetails.resultFee); // May fail
}

if (requestDetails.batchFee > 0) {
    // ...
    _transferFee(batchSender, requestDetails.batchFee); // May fail
}

if (refundAmount > 0) {
    _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount); // May fail
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Calling function _transferFee failed.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- If the first transfer (requestFee distribution) and the second transfer (resultFee distribution) succeed, but the third transfer (batchFee distribution) fails
- When calling the `postResult` function again, all transfer logic will be re-executed, potentially causing requestFee and resultFee to be paid twice

### Impact

If any transfer step fails during the execution of the `postResult` function (e.g., the recipient contract rejects ETH or runs out of gas), the entire transaction will revert.


When users try to call the `postResult` function again, the system will not correctly identify whether this request has been processed before, potentially leading to some fees being paid multiple times.







### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a retry mechanism that tracks which fee types have been paid and which haven't, so that only unpaid portions are processed after a failure
