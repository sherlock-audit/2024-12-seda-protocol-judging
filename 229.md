# postResult

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122
From this code, we can see that the **most likely pitfall is how the `gasUsed` and `gasLimit` are handled in the `postResult` function**. There's a section of the code that calculates the share for the "payback address" (`paybackAddress`):

```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
```

If `result.gasUsed` is not constrained and exceeds `requestDetails.gasLimit`, the result of

```solidity
(result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit
```

might be greater than `requestDetails.requestFee`, leading to

```solidity
requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee
```

becoming a negative number, which would trigger an integer underflow in Solidity 0.8+ and cause a revert.

In other words, the **logical flaw** here is:  
1. There is no check to ensure that `gasUsed <= gasLimit` beforehand.  
2. There is no cap on the computed `submitterFee`.

Once the scenario of "actual gas used exceeding the declared gasLimit" occurs, the entire transaction will revert due to the safety checks.


## Summary of Vulnerability Cause

In the `postResult` function of the contract, the following logic is used to calculate the share of the "request fee" (`requestFee`) to be awarded to the result submitter (e.g., an oracle node):

```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee;
```

If there is no check beforehand to ensure that `result.gasUsed <= requestDetails.gasLimit`, then when an unusually large `result.gasUsed` is passed in:

1. The calculated `submitterFee` may be greater than `requestDetails.requestFee`.
2. This leads to an underflow when executing `requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee`.
3. In Solidity 0.8+, integer underflows **automatically trigger a revert**, causing the entire transaction to roll back.

Although this won't directly allow the malicious actor to "profit" or "steal funds," it can be exploited for a **DoS attack**. As long as someone submits a `gasUsed` value far greater than the `gasLimit`, the transaction will instantly revert due to overflow checks, preventing the request from being completed.

## Attack Path (DoS Scenario)

Below is a typical sequence for exploiting a DoS attack (assuming the contract lacks proper signature verification for the submitter or other checks are weak, or the attacker can pre-emptively satisfy such requirements):

1. **Observe an incomplete request (`requestId`)**  
   The contract's `pendingRequests` set contains a request eligible for result submission.

2. **Malicious actor (attacker) calls `postResult`**  
   - When constructing the `SedaDataTypes.Result calldata result`, the attacker intentionally sets `result.gasUsed` to a value far greater than `requestDetails.gasLimit`.
   - Other fields (e.g., `drId`, signature, etc.) are disguised to appear valid or meet basic submission requirements (if the contract has flaws in signature verification, it becomes easier to bypass; strict validation may require further forgeries or bypass techniques).

3. **Trigger integer underflow leading to automatic revert**  
   - In the `postResult` logic, the following line executes:
     ```solidity
     uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
     refundAmount += requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee; // <-- Potential underflow
     ```
   - Since `submitterFee` becomes greater than `requestDetails.requestFee` (which happens easily when `gasUsed > gasLimit`), the operation `requestDetails.requestFee - submitterFee` causes an underflow, which **automatically reverts** the transaction.

4. **Request submission fails, cannot be completed**  
   - Because the transaction reverts, the request remains in a pending state.
   - If the contract or ecosystem depends on continuous result submissions to complete the request, this request is now **blocked**.

5. **Repeated attacks**  
   - The attacker can repeatedly submit "malicious results" in the same way, causing the transaction to revert each time. Everyone trying to complete the request must be cautious.
   - In some cases, this could lead to legitimate submitters having to pay more Gas fees to test repeatedly or even modify the contract to successfully complete the request, forming a **DoS** attack mechanism.

## Impact and Mitigation

- **Impact**  
  - Although this vulnerability does not directly result in "theft of contract funds," it prevents normal users from completing requests (or at least requires non-standard operations to do so), making it a **classic DoS attack vector**.
  - If external contracts or services depend on these request results, the off-chain business logic could be blocked, delayed, or even rendered inoperable.

- **Mitigation Strategies**  
  1. **Check `gasUsed <= gasLimit`**  
     Before calculating the `submitterFee`, explicitly check:
     ```solidity
     if (result.gasUsed > requestDetails.gasLimit) {
         revert("Gas used exceeds limit");
     }
     ```
     This avoids large invalid numbers directly causing errors in the fee calculation and triggering underflows.

  2. **Apply a cap to `submitterFee`**  
     Even if `gasUsed` is not checked, the calculation can be capped (clamped) afterward, for example:
     ```solidity
     uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
     if (submitterFee > requestDetails.requestFee) {
         submitterFee = requestDetails.requestFee;
     }
     ```
     This ensures that no matter how large `gasUsed` is, the "fee awarded to the submitter" will not exceed the `requestFee`, preventing underflows.

### How to Fix or Avoid This Issue

1. **Limit `gasUsed <= gasLimit` when submitting results**  
   You can add a check in `postResult`:

   ```solidity
   if (result.gasUsed > requestDetails.gasLimit) {
       revert("Gas used cannot exceed gas limit");
   }
   ```

   This explicitly prevents `submitterFee` from exceeding `requestFee`, thus avoiding the underflow error that would occur later.

2. **Clamp the final computed `submitterFee` with a min-max range**  
   For example:

   ```solidity
   uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
   if (submitterFee > requestDetails.requestFee) {
       submitterFee = requestDetails.requestFee;
   }
   ```

   This ensures that even if someone tries to pass an excessively high `gasUsed`, `submitterFee` will never exceed `requestDetails.requestFee`.

In either case, it's essential to ensure that the "fee to be given to the submitter" does not exceed the "originally received fee," thus avoiding underflow errors and making the logic more sound.
