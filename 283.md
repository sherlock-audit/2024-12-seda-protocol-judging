# Fee Distribution can be Dos'd by malicious receiver (BatchSender or  refundReceiptient)


## Summary
For cases where a data requester has been able to see his result on the `seda-chain` or has realised that his request was not successfully completed, he can decide to refuse distribution of fees to allow time for the `timeOutPeriod` to reach and be able to claim his amount without paying validators. Since the batchSending is also open, malicious batch senders can also do`s the system to prevent the whole results of a specific batch from ever being completed.

### Root Cause
Sending fees to receipts directly without then getting it themselves.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- A data requester submits a data request but after some time realizes that he made some mistakes in his input where an error will be returned or undesired data will be sent to him or is no longer interested in the data.
- When the protocol finalizes it and its time to receive its(the protocol) fees, and the requester has a refund. Upon sending the refund, he keeps reverting it to prevent the transaction from completing.
- He keeps doing this up to when the timeout for the request has reached where the user will be able to withdraw the full amount he deposited.
 
[The refund to User](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L196C9-L199C10)
```solidity
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```

or

A malicious batch sender may just want to do`s the protocol and will prevent the entire batch's results from ever being posted hence reducing the protocal's credibility.

### Impact

Loss of funds by genuine parties involved in processing a request like the sender/solver. Which leads to a loss of funds to the protocol.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consinder using mappings to just increment fees of the different parties during distribution where they can claim their fees individually without you sending the funds to them.
