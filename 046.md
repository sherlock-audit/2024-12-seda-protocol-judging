# requestor can prevent postResult

### Summary

requestor can force request to timeout, by reverting on `postResult -> _transferFee`. Then collect back his deposit.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L196
```solidity
function postResult(
...
        // Aggregate refund to requestor containing:
        // - unused request fees (when gas used < gas limit)
        // - full request fee (when invalid payback address)
        // - batch fee (when no batch sender)
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
@>            _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```

Malicious `requestor` can prevent posting the result by reverting on eth receive.

After the timeout period passes he can call `withdrawTimedOutRequest` and get back his funds.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Malicious requestor prevents `postResult` by reverting/returnbomb on eth transfer. He can ensure `refundAmount > 0` by increasing the fees.
2. After `timeoutPeriod` he calls `withdrawTimedOutRequest`.

### Impact

Not paying for work done. Causing funds loss for solvers who paid for his request on seda chain.
