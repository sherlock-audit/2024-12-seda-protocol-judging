# Malicious Executors can copy others commitments without running the oracle program

### Summary

One executor can simply copy the reveal commitment hash of an honest executor during the commit stage and reveal the same executors answer during the reveal stage. This allows a malicious executor to participate in the consensus process and gain fees without ever actually executing the oracle programs 

### Root Cause

The RevealBody struct which is hashed to generate hash commitments, and is revealed during the reveal stage contains no unique information to prevent one executor from copying the results of another executor

```rust
pub struct RevealBody {
    pub id:                String,
    pub salt:              String,
    pub exit_code:         u8,
    pub gas_used:          u64,
    pub reveal:            Bytes,
    pub proxy_public_keys: Vec<String>,
}

//reveal stage
impl ExecuteHandler for execute::reveal_result::Execute {
    fn execute(self, deps: DepsMut, env: Env, _info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
       //hash the reveal struct
        let reveal_body_hash = self.reveal_body.try_hash()?;
        //compare it to the already submitted hash which is copied
        let Some(committed_dr_result) = dr.get_commitment(&self.public_key) else {
            return Err(ContractError::NotCommitted);
        };
```
A malicious executor can just copy another executors RevealBody/commitment hash on the commit stage and the exact RevealBody on the reveal stage without ever knowing the actual answer.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A data request needs to be submitted and there needs to exist multiple validators who can vote

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker and an honest executor both observe a data request and go to commit a data result
2. Honest executors run the oracle program and commit their result hashes
3. The malicious executor observes the honest executors commitments (but cannot see the actual results yet) and submits an identical commitment hash without running the oracle program
4. When the reveal phase begins, honest executors reveal their results
5. Attacker sees the revealed results and reveals the same result, matching their earlier commitment
6. The system cannot distinguish between executors who actually ran the program and those who merely copied others' results

### Impact

The protocol suffers reduced computational redundancy and security guarantees. The replication factor, which is intended to provide redundant computation for security, is effectively reduced since some executors aren't actually performing independent execution. Additionally, executors are receiving payment for work they never did.


### Mitigation

Include the executors public key in the RevealBody struct and at reveal_result runtime verify that the msg.sender is this same address. This forces each executor to have a unique commitment even for the same answer
