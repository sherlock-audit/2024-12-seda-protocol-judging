# Invalid Time Handling & Non-Determinism in Seda Protocol

### Summary

The use of time.Now() and floating-point arithmetic in consensus settings will cause non-determinism for the blockchain network as nodes will compute different values, potentially breaking consensus and leading to chain forks or unfair validator slashing.

### Root Cause

In [integration.go](https://github/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/integration/integration.go#L117-L118), the system time (time.Now()) is used instead of the deterministic ctx.BlockTime().

In [config_defaults.go](https://github/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/config_defaults.go#L15-L16), floating-point arithmetic is used in time calculations, which can introduce rounding errors and inconsistencies between nodes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The node needs to process a transaction using time.Now() instead of ctx.BlockTime().

The floating-point arithmetic in consensus settings must be executed, potentially causing inconsistent timeouts.

### External Pre-conditions

Different nodes execute transactions at slightly different times, leading to variations in time.Now() values.

Floating-point calculations differ slightly across hardware and software environments, leading to non-deterministic values.

### Attack Path

A validator processes a block and assigns time.Now() to the block header.

Another validator processes the same block but calculates a slightly different timestamp.

Nodes disagree on the block timestamp, causing consensus failure and potential chain forking.

Validators processing time-based operations with floating-point arithmetic compute slightly different values.

This inconsistency causes validators to have different timeout values, leading to potential unfair slashing or stalled consensus.



### Impact

The blockchain network suffers from potential chain forks due to non-deterministic timestamps.

Validators may be unfairly slashed due to inconsistent timeout calculations.

### PoC

N/A (issue is conceptual and based on incorrect use of system time and floating-point arithmetic)

### Mitigation

Replace all instances of time.Now() with ctx.BlockTime() to ensure deterministic time handling.

Avoid floating-point arithmetic in time calculations; use integer-based calculations instead, such as:
```solidity
cfg.Consensus.TimeoutPropose = 7500 * time.Millisecond
cfg.Consensus.TimeoutCommit = 7500 * time.Millisecond
```
