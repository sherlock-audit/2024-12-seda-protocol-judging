# ExecuteTallyVM has a memory leak which will lead to nodes eventually crashing

### Summary

The continuous memory allocation without freeing in `execute.go` will cause a memory leak for node operators as each block will lose a small amount of memory, eventually depleting the node's resources over extended operation periods.


### Root Cause


In `execute.go` the `configDirC` C string is allocated with `C.CString(LogDir)` but never freed with `C.free(unsafe.Pointer(configDirC))`, unlike all other C string allocations in the same function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The SEDA node is running and processing blocks
2. The `ExecuteTallyVm` function is called from the `EndBlock` function
3. The `LogDir` global variable is set to a non-empty string path

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The Tally module's `EndBlock` function is called automatically at the end of each block
2. This calls `ProcessTallies` which processes data requests ready for tallying
3. For each tally operation, the `FilterAndTally` method is invoked
4. This ultimately executes the `ExecuteTallyVm` function in `execute.go`
5. Each execution allocates memory for `configDirC` without freeing it
6. The allocated memory accumulates over time as each block is processed
7. Eventually, after running for an extended period, the node will run out of memory

### Impact

The SEDA node operators suffer a continuous memory leak that will eventually lead to degraded performance and potential node crashes. The amount of memory leaked per block is equal to the length of the `LogDir` string plus 1 byte (for the null terminator).
For a typical path length of ~30 bytes, `/home/seda/.seda/tally-logs\00`, a default MaxTalliesPerBlock of 100, and an average of 20 data requests per block, this will add up to ~3gb of allocated memory that is leaked each year. Longer paths, more data requests per block will result in a faster leakage and result in an eventual crash for all systems. Systems with lower specs will crash sooner rather than later

### Mitigation

just like with all the other C.Cstring initializations in the function, add the line:
```go
defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(configDirC)
```
