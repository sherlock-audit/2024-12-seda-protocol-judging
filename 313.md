        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
