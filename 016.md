# Funds to be withdrawn can be stolen due to incorrect variable usage

### Summary

Funds to be withdrawn can be stolen due to incorrect variable usage

### Root Cause

Upon executing the withdrawal through `withdraw::execute()`, this piece of code is incorrect:
```rust
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };
```
The funds are sent to the sender of the transaction instead of to the user who is actually the owner of those funds.

Since there is a pubkey verification at the beginning of the function, an attacker has to conduct a frontrun (possible in CosmWasm, also confirmed by the sponsors) with the exact same params as the legitimate withdrawal. Then, everything will pass the same way it would with a regular withdrawal, but the funds will be sent to the sender.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No internal pre-conditions_

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. Bob has 100 tokens as a pending withdrawal
2. He makes a transaction to withdraw them with the necessary inputs
3. Alice frontruns him with the exact same inputs, the transaction passes and the funds are sent to the sender which is her
4. Bob is left with no tokens

### Impact

Direct theft of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Send the funds to the actual staker, not to the sender.
