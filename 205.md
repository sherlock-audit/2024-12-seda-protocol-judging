# Multiple batch posting transactions pending in mempool might result in some batches not getting posted

### Summary

When submitting results, the `postBatch` function requires that each new batch height must be greater than the previous one.

If two pending `postBatch` transactions become stuck simultaneously in the mempool (for example, on Ethereum mainnet), and the transaction with the higher batch height is included first, the earlier batch will not settle. This results in some batches not being submitted.

Considering that each block on **Seda Chain** takes approximately **~8 seconds**, and each block on **Ethereum** takes about **~12 seconds**, there's a significant possibility that if the first batch isn't included promptly within an Ethereum block, both batches will compete against each other for inclusion in the same Ethereum block, if the one with higher height is included, the other one will be lost.

### Root Cause

`postBatch` checks that batch height is incremental:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L97-L99
```solidity
        if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
This means that if a valid (or multiple) batches are pending in the mempool (lets say in a crowded condition), then if a batch with higher height is included before the other ones, the previous ones can not be submitted and are lost.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Contract must not be in `paused` state

### External Pre-conditions

1. Few batch submission transaction in pending status
2. transaction with a higher batch height included first

### Attack Path

1. Solver `A` submits batch number `8`
2. Due to gas fluctuation, the batch submission is in pending state
3. After 7 seconds the next SEDA block is produced, the endblocker of batcher module returns a new batch
4. Solver `B` submits batch number `9` but with a higher gas fee than Solver `A`
5. batch number `9` is included immediately because the gas fee is higher
6. batch number `8` can not be included, since the batch height is less than the previous one, also the requests are market as `included in a batch` on the seda chain

### Impact

In a busy network condition, some batches might get lost due to this gas races and transactions stay pending in the mempool, this means that some request will be left without any results, which might harm any services integrated with SEDA chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Mabe check that new height is +1 last height? this will force inclusion of all batches, although some of batch submissions revert ( in the above example ) but we are sure that all requests are answered.
```solidity
        //@audit mabe check that new height is last height + 1
        if (newBatch.batchHeight != s.lastBatchHeight + 1) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
