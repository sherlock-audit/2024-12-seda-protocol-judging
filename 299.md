# GetFeeUpdatePubKeys Loads a Huge Number of Records at Once in EndBlock, Causing a DoS Vulnerability

### Summary

Loading a large number of fee update records with the same `activationHeight` **all at once into memory** can result in **excessive memory usage and lead to a DoS vulnerability**. This affects the normal execution of **EndBlock** on full nodes because an **attacker or malicious user** can repeatedly create a large number of fee updates that share the same `activationHeight`. As a result, once `EndBlock` processes these updates, it can cause the chain to slow down or halt.

### Root Cause

1. **Within the `GetFeeUpdatePubKeys` function** (in `keeper/fee_queue.go` or a similar file):
    
    ```go
    func (k Keeper) GetFeeUpdatePubKeys(ctx sdk.Context, activationHeight int64) ([][]byte, error) {
        rng := collections.NewPrefixedPairRange[int64, []byte](activationHeight)
        itr, err := k.feeUpdateQueue.Iterate(ctx, rng)
        // ...
        keys, err := itr.Keys()     // Here, all matching keys are loaded into the keys list at once
        // ...
        for _, k := range keys {
            pubkeys = append(pubkeys, k.K2())
        }
        return pubkeys, nil
    }
    ```
    
    This code **loads every record** with the same `activationHeight` into the `keys` array in a single operation. If there are tens of thousands of fee updates targeting the same height, the resulting memory allocation can be extremely large.
    
2. **In `ProcessFeeUpdates` / `EndBlock`**:
    
    ```go
    func (k *Keeper) EndBlock(ctx sdk.Context) (err error) {
        // ...
        err = k.ProcessFeeUpdates(ctx) // Calls GetFeeUpdatePubKeys internally
        if err != nil {
            return
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    
    Because this logic is triggered **in EndBlock**, any sudden surge in memory usage or an extended processing time may cause the node to stall or time out, creating a **DoS risk**.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. An **attacker** or **malicious user** repeatedly submits transactions (such as through `EditDataProxy` or another interface) that write fee updates to the queue.
2. Within these transactions, they set the **`FeeUpdateDelay`** to the same value (so that each resulting fee update shares the same `activationHeight`), or otherwise ensure that a large number of “fee updates” become effective at the same height.
3. Once the block height reaches (or exceeds) that `activationHeight`, **EndBlock** executes `ProcessFeeUpdates`:
    - `GetFeeUpdatePubKeys(ctx, blockHeight)` is called.
    - All records match that height, so the result of `Iterate(ctx, rng)` is enormous. A single call to `keys, err := itr.Keys()` loads all of them into memory at once.
4. **Node memory usage spikes**, potentially causing the node to crash, become unresponsive, or even halt network progress, achieving a **DoS effect**.

### Impact

- **Affected Parties**: All network participants running full nodes (including validator nodes).
- **Possible Outcomes**:
    - With extremely large amounts of fee update records, **nodes may crash or severely lag during EndBlock** due to excessive memory allocation.
    - **Block production is disrupted**, which can lead to halts or delays in on-chain activities, achieving **DoS**.
    - The cost of the attack depends on transaction fees and any limits on fee updates. If these costs are not high enough to deter large-scale record creation, the vulnerability can be easily exploited.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Impose a **limit on the number of records** that share the same `activationHeight`. Setting an upper bound or introducing additional economic costs can help prevent users from creating too many fee updates for a single height.
