# No time delay between unstaking and withdraw

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L8C5-L39C11
In the withdrawal function code, there's a critical security issue indicated by this commented line.
// TODO: add delay after calling unstake

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L8C5-L39C11
The withdrawal function is designed to let users withdraw tokens they previously unstaked. In most staking protocols, there should be a time delay (often called a "cooling period" or "unbonding period") between unstaking tokens and being able to withdraw them. This delay serves several important purposes.
However, the current implementation has no such delay mechanism. This means:

A user can unstake their tokens
Immediately call the withdraw function
Receive their tokens back without any waiting period

fn execute(self, deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // verify the proof
    let chain_id = CHAIN_ID.load(deps.storage)?;
    let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
    let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
    self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
    
    // TODO: add delay after calling unstake
    let token = TOKEN.load(deps.storage)?;
    
    // error if amount is greater than pending tokens
    let mut executor = state::STAKERS.get_staker(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
    // ...rest of function...

After verifying the proof, the function immediately proceeds to check if the user has sufficient pending withdrawal tokens and then sends the tokens. There is:

No timestamp check against when the tokens were unstaked
No storage of when unstaking occurred
No comparison against a configured delay period
No mechanism to enforce a waiting period

### Impact

No time delay between unstaking and withdraw

### PoC

No time delay between unstaking and withdraw

### Mitigation

UNSTAKING_TIME.save(deps.storage, &public_key, &env.block.time.seconds())?;
let unstaking_time = UNSTAKING_TIME.may_load(deps.storage, &public_key)?
    .ok_or(ContractError::NoUnstakingRecord)?;
    
let withdrawal_delay = WITHDRAWAL_DELAY.load(deps.storage)?;
    
if env.block.time.seconds() < unstaking_time + withdrawal_delay {
    return Err(ContractError::WithdrawalTooEarly {
        current_time: env.block.time.seconds(),
        eligible_time: unstaking_time + withdrawal_delay,
    });
}
