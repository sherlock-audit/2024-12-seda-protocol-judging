# No differentiation between vested token balance and regular balance will cause issues

### Summary

No differentiation between vested token balance and regular balance will cause issues

### Root Cause

Users can vest tokens to an account and they can then use the clawback functionality to get any not yet vested tokens. However, there is no differentiation between tokens that were vested to the receiver and tokens that the receiver might have gotten from another place (e.g. a simple token transfer or even already vested tokens). This will result in multiple different impacts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The vesting receiver has tokens from somewhere else (e.g. simple token transfer)

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. Bob has vested 100 tokens to Alice which he wants to clawback (assuming that he will clawback immediately for simplicity purposes)
2. Alice has bonded all of the 100 tokens and has been slashed due to inactivity, that is a 1% penalty and now she has 99 tokens bonded (this is theoretically impossible as we assumed the clawback was immediate and there would be no time for her to be inactive but this is just an imaginary scenario for simplicity purposes)
3. Alice has received 100 tokens from somewhere else, let's say someone transferred her tokens for some reason
4. We have this piece of code:
```go
	bonded := sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(bondDenom, bondedAmt))
	unbonding := sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(bondDenom, unbondingAmt))
	unbonded := m.bk.GetAllBalances(ctx, vestingAccAddr)
	total := bonded.Add(unbonding...).Add(unbonded...)

	toClawBack := coinsMin(vestingAccount.GetVestingCoins(ctx.BlockTime()), total)
```
5. `bonded` would be 99, `unbonding` would be 0, `unbonded` would be 100, thus `toClawBack` will be `min(100, 199) -> 100`
6. We then have these 2 lines:
```go
	spendable := m.bk.SpendableCoins(ctx, vestingAccAddr)
	toXfer := coinsMin(toClawBack, spendable)
```
7. `spendable` would be 100, thus `toXfer` will also be 100
8. We clawback the 100 tokens afterwards

This functions incorrectly, will explain why this is wrong in the impact section.

### Impact

There are 2 separate impacts here.

Firstly, in the example in the attack path, we sent 100 tokens to Bob. This is incorrect as Alice got slashed and she only had 99 tokens out of the 100 initially vested, Bob should receive __at most__ 99. This can be verified by the function comment, the slashing should be taken into account:
> Note that due to slashing the funds from all three of these sources may still fail to meet the vesting amount according to the vesting schedule.

Secondly, as written in both the [audit overview](https://sedaprotocol.notion.site/SEDA-Protocol-Audit-Overview-190a68d575ca807ca2a2d4e232a77781#191a68d575ca80cebdc4eb210191dd79) (`x/vesting` section) and as written in the comments:
>// The funds are transferred from the following sources
// 1. vesting funds that have not been used towards delegation
// 2. delegations
// 3. unbonding delegations

We should transfer the funds from the vesting funds, from the delegations and from the unbonding delegations. Here, we transferred them from neither of those as there were no vesting funds, they were all bonded, thus Alice would have had 0 spendable balance if she didn't have tokens from a different place (NOTE: Even though the clawback was immediate, the vesting balance which is not bonded becomes immediately spendable as we set the end time of the vest to the current timestamp, effectively fully vesting it immediately). They also did not come from any delegations. They came directly from Alice's balance which was received from a different place. This is completely unintended and effectively breaks how the function is supposed to work.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider only including the unvested tokens by having a balance cache before the `vestingAccount.EndTime = ctx.BlockTime().Unix()` line and then subtract the cached balance from the new spendable balance.
