# Malicious Genesis Account Injection

### Summary


The function addGenesisAccountCmd allows adding new accounts to genesis.json, but it does not fully validate the address format or ensure it belongs to the correct blockchain.

This opens up an attack vector where an attacker can inject a malicious or malformed address into the genesis file, causing potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or loss of funds.

addr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(args[0])
if err != nil {
    // Attempt to fetch the key from the keyring
    info, err := kb.Key(args[0])
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to get address from Keybase: %w", err)
    }
    addr, err = info.GetAddress()
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to get address from Keybase: %w", err)
    }
}



he function does not validate the address prefix (e.g., cosmos1..., osmo1..., etc.).
If args[0] is a malformed or an external chain address, it bypasses the validation and gets stored in genesis.json.
Later, when the blockchain boots up, it tries to initialize with the corrupted genesis.json and fails.


Exploit Scenarios

 Scenario 1: Injecting an Address from Another Chain
Attackers submit a valid Bech32 address from another Cosmos-based chain (e.g., Osmosis, Juno, Akash).
The function does not check if the address belongs to the current chain.
The blockchain fails to start or creates an unreachable account.

 Scenario 2: Injecting a Malformed Address
An attacker generates an invalid Bech32 address (e.g., "cosmos1abcdef1234567890wrong") and submits it.
The function blindly adds the malformed address to genesis.json.
At chain startup, the system throws an error and refuses to initialize â†’ Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack.


 Scenario 3: Injecting an Address That Can't Be Recovered
If a malformed or external address receives tokens, funds may be permanently lost.
No one can access the injected address, leading to locked assets.

### Impact

Chain startup failure (DoS attack).  Funds sent to unreachable addresses. Malicious actor controls voting power by injecting fake accounts




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Step 1: Enforce Address Prefix Validation

if !strings.HasPrefix(addr.String(), "cosmos1") {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid address format: %s", addr.String())
}

This ensures only addresses with the correct Bech32 prefix are allowed.
 Step 2: Validate Address with the Cosmos SDK

if err := sdk.ValidateAccAddress(addr.String()); err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid account address: %s", addr.String())
}

This prevents malformed or tampered addresses.
 Step 3: Check Against Chain-ID-Specific Rules

If the blockchain has custom rules for valid addresses, enforce them before adding to genesis.json.
