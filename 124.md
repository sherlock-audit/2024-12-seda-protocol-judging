# Missing Capability Scoping Will Break IBC Fee Processing in Seda

### Summary 
`IBCFeeKeeper` was not scoped before sealing CapabilityKeeper, preventing the IBC Fee Middleware from processing fees. This led to unpaid relayers, failed fee-enabled IBC transactions, and governance inability to fix the issue without a hard fork.

### Vulnerability Details
As can be seen, IBCFeeKeeper is declared as a scoped keeper in `app/keepers.go`, 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/keepers/keepers.go

```golang
type AppKeepers struct {
...
	ScopedIBCKeeper           capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
	ScopedICAHostKeeper       capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
	ScopedICAControllerKeeper capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
	ScopedTransferKeeper      capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
	ScopedIBCFeeKeeper        capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
	ScopedWasmKeeper          capabilitykeeper.ScopedKeeper
}
```
but its never actually scoped in `app.go` before sealing the `CapabilityKeeper`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-chain/app/app.go#L364-L376
```golang
	// add capability keeper and ScopeToModule for ibc module
	app.CapabilityKeeper = capabilitykeeper.NewKeeper(
		appCodec,
		keys[capabilitytypes.StoreKey],
		memKeys[capabilitytypes.MemStoreKey],
	)

	// grant capabilities for the ibc and ibc-transfer modules
	scopedIBCKeeper := app.CapabilityKeeper.ScopeToModule(ibcexported.ModuleName)
	scopedICAHostKeeper := app.CapabilityKeeper.ScopeToModule(icahosttypes.SubModuleName)
	scopedICAControllerKeeper := app.CapabilityKeeper.ScopeToModule(icacontrollertypes.SubModuleName)
	scopedTransferKeeper := app.CapabilityKeeper.ScopeToModule(ibctransfertypes.ModuleName)
	scopedWasmKeeper := app.CapabilityKeeper.ScopeToModule(wasmtypes.ModuleName)
	app.CapabilityKeeper.Seal()
```

Without `ScopeToModule()`, `IBCFeeKeeper` remains without a scoped capability, preventing the IBC Fee Middleware from properly handling fees. Since `CapabilityKeeper` was sealed before assigning a scoped capability, it became impossible to modify later, making governance unable to fix the issue without a hard fork. This resulted in relayers not receiving fees and IBC transactions failing when fees were required.



### Impact
- **Relayers Unpaid:** Fee processing failure resulted in relayers not receiving payments, causing IBC packets to remain unrelayed.
- **IBC Transactions Failed:** Transactions requiring relayer incentives were rejected due to missing fee middleware.
- **Governance Limitation:** Fixing the issue required a hard fork since CapabilityKeeper was already sealed.

### Mitigation 
Scope `IBCFeeKeeper` using `ScopeToModule(ibcfeetypes.ModuleName)` before sealing CapabilityKeeper.
