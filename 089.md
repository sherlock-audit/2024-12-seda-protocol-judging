# Unchecked Nil WasmKeeper in CommitRevealDecorator Causes Runtime Panic

In the provided code, while initializing the ante handler in [NewAnteHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/ante.go#L26-L41), only `options.WasmStorageKeeper` is checked for nil, leaving `options.WasmKeeper` unchecked. This oversight means that the `CommitRevealDecorator` is created without validating the `WasmKeeper` instance. For example, in the function `queryContract`, the code directly calls `d.wasmKeeper.QuerySmart(ctx, coreContract, queryBytes)` without any prior nil check, as shown below:  
```go
queryRes, err := d.wasmKeeper.QuerySmart(ctx, coreContract, queryBytes)
```
If `options.WasmKeeper` is nil, this call will result in a nil pointer dereference, causing a runtime panic and immediate termination of the transaction processing.

**Impact:**  
This vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the ante handler, thereby disrupting critical fee processing and state transition operations.

**Mitigation:**  
Validate that `WasmKeeper` is non-nil during initialization in `NewAnteHandler` to prevent any nil pointer dereference errors.
