# Signatures for the first batch will be rejected by VerifyVoteExtensionHandler

### Summary

An incorrect check for the first batch number will result in all vote extensions with batch signatures being rejected.

### Root Cause

In the [`VerifyVoteExtensionHandler`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L159-L163), a signature is verified to ensure it was properly signed by an active validator:

```golang
	err = h.verifyBatchSignatures(ctx, batch.BatchNumber, batch.BatchId, req.VoteExtension, req.ValidatorAddress)
	if err != nil {
		h.logger.Error("failed to verify batch signature", "req", req, "err", err)
		return nil, err
	}
```

To ensure the batch was signed with the correct key used by the validator at the time of signing, the public key record is retrieved from the validator tree entry of the [previous batch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L370-L380):

```golang
	valEntry, err := h.batchingKeeper.GetValidatorTreeEntry(ctx, batchNum-1, valOper)
	if err != nil {
		if errors.Is(err, collections.ErrNotFound) {
			if len(voteExtension) == 0 {
				return nil
			}
			return ErrUnexpectedBatchSignature
		}
		return err
	}
	expectedAddr = valEntry.EthAddress
```

There is an inherent cold start issue: when the very first batch is signed, there is no previous record to verify the validator's key. In this case, the code defaults to [using the current key](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L360-L369) as stored in the `x/pubkey` module:

```golang
	if batchNum == collections.DefaultSequenceStart {
		pubKey, err := h.pubKeyKeeper.GetValidatorKeyAtIndex(ctx, valOper, utils.SEDAKeyIndexSecp256k1)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
		expectedAddr, err = utils.PubKeyToEthAddress(pubKey)
		if err != nil {
			return err
		}
	} else {
               // ... skipped for brevity ...
        }
```

However, the condition used to check whether it is the first batch is incorrect. The numbering [starts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L69-L72) from `collections.DefaultSequenceStart + 1` and only increments, meaning the condition `batchNum == collections.DefaultSequenceStart` will never be satisfied:

```golang
	if !errors.Is(err, types.ErrBatchingHasNotStarted) {
		return types.Batch{}, types.DataResultTreeEntries{}, nil, err
	}
	newBatchNum = collections.DefaultSequenceStart + 1
```

This causes the code to follow the default branch, where the validator key is not found, leading to the extension vote being rejected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Happens for the first batch only.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

See the explanation in the Root Cause section 

### Impact

Inability to sign the first batch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The check for the first batch must be `if batchNum == collections.DefaultSequenceStart + 1`
