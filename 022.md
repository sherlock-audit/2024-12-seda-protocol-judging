# Incorrect value usage upon transferring a delegation will result in incorrect fails

### Summary

Incorrect value usage upon transferring a delegation will result in incorrect fails

### Root Cause

Upon cancelling a vesting, we call `keeper::TransferDelegation()`, we have this simplified piece of code:
```go
	err = k.IterateDelegatorRedelegations(ctx, fromAddr, func(toRedelegation sdktypes.Redelegation) (stop bool) {
		...
		maxEntries, err := k.MaxEntries(ctx)
		...
		fromRedelegation, err := k.GetRedelegation(ctx, fromAddr, valSrcAddr, valDstAddr)
		...
		if err == nil && len(toRedelegation.Entries)+len(fromRedelegation.Entries) >= int(maxEntries) {
			mightExceedLimit = true
			return true
		}
		return false
	})
```
As written in a comment in the function, we are assuming that all redelegations __will have__ to be transferred. If we reach the `maxEntries`, we have an early return and we do not conduct any transfers.

The issue is that the code is incorrect and will lead to a wrong check for the limit. It provides `fromAddr` as an input which is the account being vested to. Then, in the callback function provided, `toRedelegation` is the redelegation of the `fromAddr` we are currently iterating over. Then, in this line:
```go
fromRedelegation, err := k.GetRedelegation(ctx, fromAddr, valSrcAddr, valDstAddr)
```
We are essentially getting the same redelegation as we are again using the `fromAddr` and the `valSrcAddr` and `valDstAddr` are directly taken from the redelegation:
```go
valSrcAddr, err := sdk.ValAddressFromBech32(toRedelegation.ValidatorSrcAddress)
valDstAddr, err := sdk.ValAddressFromBech32(toRedelegation.ValidatorDstAddress)
```
The check is always done with the same redelegation which is incorrect. It should be done with the redelegations of the `toAddr` and the redelegations of the `fromAddr`.

As the input name to the callback is `toRedelegation`, the assumption is that we are getting the redelegations of the `to` address, however that is incorrect as the input we are providing is the `fromAddr`. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No internal pre-conditions_

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. The limit is 10, the `fromAddr` has 9 redelegations for the according source and destination, the `toAddr` has 0
2. Instead of the code checking `9 + 0 >= 10 -> false`, the code will check `9 + 9 >= 18 -> true`
3. The delegation transfer will early return, this can lead to a loss of funds for the vesting account creator as the transfer won't work
### Impact

2 options:
- we won't early return despite having to
- we will early return despite not having to

The second case, specifically, can lead to a loss of funds for the vesting account creator as explained in the attack path.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- err = k.IterateDelegatorRedelegations(ctx, fromAddr, func(toRedelegation sdktypes.Redelegation) (stop bool) {
+ err = k.IterateDelegatorRedelegations(ctx, toAddr, func(toRedelegation sdktypes.Redelegation) (stop bool) {
       ...
})
```
