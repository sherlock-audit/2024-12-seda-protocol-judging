# If the input data is smaller than `nonceSize`, the slicing operation will panic due to an "index out of range" error

The [decryptBytes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/seda_keys.go#L329-L353) function does not validate that the provided data is long enough before slicing it to extract the nonce and encrypted payload, which can result in a runtime panic when the data is shorter than the required nonce size. In the code snippet below, the function calls `gcm.NonceSize()` to determine the size of the nonce and immediately attempts to slice the input data with `data[:nonceSize]` and `data[nonceSize:]` without checking if `len(data)` is at least `nonceSize`: 

```go
nonceSize := gcm.NonceSize()
nonce, encryptedData := data[:nonceSize], data[nonceSize:]
```

This lack of input length verification directly causes a panic ("index out of range" error) when the provided data is insufficient, as there is no error handling to manage such a case within the function.

**Impact:**  
Leads to an application crash (denial-of-service) when processing malformed or truncated data.

**Mitigation:**  
Add a length check before slicing the data to ensure `len(data) >= nonceSize`.
