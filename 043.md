# Malicious validator/frontrunner can hijack data proxy registration

### Summary

`AdminAddress` is not included in the signed payload during data proxy registration. This allows a malicious validator to replace a legitimate transaction with their own, using the same data proxy's public key but substituting `AdminAddress` with one they control.

### Root Cause

During the data-proxy registration, a signature of payload consisting of serialized `fee`, `payoutAddress`, `memo` plus `chainId` is verified to ensure that the message sender owns a public key they want to use. However, this payload does not include [`AdminAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L81-L81) leading to a possibility of replacing it without breaking the signature check:

```golang
	payload := make([]byte, 0, len(feeBytes)+len(payoutAddressBytes)+len(memoBytes))
	payload = append(payload, feeBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, payoutAddressBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, memoBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, []byte(ctx.ChainID())...)

@>	if valid := secp256k1.VerifySignature(pubKeyBytes, crypto.Keccak256(payload), signatureBytes); !valid {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidSignature.Wrap("Invalid data proxy registration signature")
	}

	proxyConfig := types.ProxyConfig{
		PayoutAddress: msg.PayoutAddress,
		Fee:           msg.Fee,
		Memo:          msg.Memo,
		FeeUpdate:     nil,
@>		AdminAddress:  msg.AdminAddress, // @audit can be manipulated
	}
```

By doing so, a malicious actor will hijack a data proxy ownership, allowing them to [update the payout address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L119-L126) and benefit from rewards earned by the proxy.


### Internal Pre-conditions

*None*

### External Pre-conditions

*None*

### Attack Path

1. A data proxy owner sends a proxy registration message.
2. Malicious validator replaces an original message with their own one, changing only `AdminAddress` field and responding success to the owner.
3. This "altered" message is getting broadcasted and accepted by the network.
4. Malicious validator sends `EditDataProxy` message, replacing payout address with the one they control.

### Impact

1. Data proxy owner loses admin control over proxy.
2. The attacker can alter the rewards payout address and fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include `AdminAddress` into the payload for signing
