# Sorting Corrupts Proofs & Enables Forgery in Merkle Trees

### Summary


Sorting leaves before constructing a Merkle tree destroys the integrity of the proof system. This introduces a serious security vulnerability where attackers can reorder entries and forge valid-looking Merkle proofs for fake data.

 How Merkle Trees Work (Correct Approach)
Merkle trees ensure data integrity and efficient inclusion proofs by recursively hashing pairs of nodes in a structured binary tree.

Leaves (transaction hashes) are inserted in their original order.
Each parent node is computed as:
𝐻parent =Hash(𝐻left child∣∣𝐻right child)        H parent=Hash(H left child∣∣H right child )
The root hash uniquely represents the entire dataset.
Proofs depend on specific ordering of leaf nodes and intermediate hashes.

 Order matters because each step of hashing must preserve the structure of the dataset.

 code incorrectly sorts leaves before building the Merkle tree:


sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
    return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
})
Security Risks of Sorting
Reordering Attacks – Multiple Valid Roots for the Same Data

Different orderings of leaves can produce identical Merkle roots.
Attackers can swap transactions in the dataset and create a valid proof for a fake transaction.
Forged Proofs – Trick Verifiers into Accepting Non-Existent Data

Since sorting allows multiple possible tree constructions, an attacker can rearrange leaves to create a fraudulent proof for data that was never in the original set.
Broken Verification – Same Entry, Different Proofs

If sorting changes the structure of the tree, proofs will be inconsistent.
A verifier might fail to verify a legitimate transaction because the proof no longer matches the expected structure.
 Attack Example: Fake Inclusion Proof
Consider four transactions:


T1: Alice → Bob
T2: Charlie → Dave
T3: Eve → Frank
T4: George → Harry
 Correct Merkle Tree (No Sorting)

     Root
     /   \
   H1     H2
  /  \   /  \
T1   T2 T3   T4

The Merkle proof for T3 includes T4, H1, and finally Root.
 Incorrect Merkle Tree (Sorting Applied)
After sorting, the order changes:


T1, T2, T3, T4  →  T1, T2, T4, T3 (Sorted Alphabetically)
Now the tree is:


     Root'
     /    \
   H1'     H2'
  /   \   /   \
T1   T2 T4   T3


This changes the proof structure for T3 since the tree is no longer the same.
Attackers can swap T3 with another transaction and still produce a proof that verifies against the same root.

 Real-World Exploit

Attacker replaces T3 with a fake transaction T3'.
Sorts the list, recalculates the tree.

Generates a valid proof for T3', convincing the verifier that it was included.
 Sorting makes it impossible to trust that a given proof corresponds to the original dataset.
