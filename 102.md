# Batch Replay Vulnerability in SEDA's Cross-Chain Architecture

### Summary

SEDA's cross-chain architecture is vulnerable to batch replay attacks, where a batch of verified results and cryptographic proofs can be replayed across multiple chains. This vulnerability arises due to the absence of a chain-specific identifier (`chainId`) in the batch structure, allowing malicious actors to exploit the system. 

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the absence of a **chain-specific identifier** (`chainId`) within the `Batch` structure. This omission makes the batches chain-agnostic, meaning they lack validation of their intended origin or destination chain. As a result, batches can be replayed across multiple chains without any mechanism to prevent such misuse.

### Key Points:

1. **Batch Structure**:
   The `Batch` struct does not include a `chainId` field, as shown below:

   ```solidity
   struct Batch {
       uint64 batchHeight;
       uint64 blockHeight;
       bytes32 validatorsRoot;
       bytes32 resultsRoot;
       bytes32 provingMetadata;
   }
   ```

   Without a `chainId`, the batch is not tied to any specific chain, making it susceptible to replay attacks.

2. **Batch Hashing**:
   The batch is hashed, but the hash does not incorporate a `chainId`. This means the hash is the same across all chains, further enabling replay attacks.

3. **Signature Verification**:
   The signature verification process checks the validity of the hash but does not account for the chain context. The `_verifySignature` function only validates the hash and the signer, as shown below:

   ```solidity
   function _verifySignature(
       bytes32 messageHash,
       bytes calldata signature,
       address signer
   ) internal pure returns (bool) {
       return ECDSA.recover(messageHash, signature) == signer;
   }
   ```

   Since the `messageHash` does not include a `chainId`, the signature can be replayed on any chain.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  SEDA EVM contract must be deployed on at least two separate EVM chains
2. A batch must be posted on at least one EVM chain


### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. **Step 1**: A legitimate **Data Request** is submitted on **Chain A** and processed by SEDA's network, resulting in a batch with verified results and cryptographic proofs.
2. **Step 2**: A malicious actor retrieves the batch and its proofs.
3. **Step 3**: The malicious actor submits the same batch to **Chain B**, where the prover contract accepts it as valid due to the absence of a `chainId` check.
4. **Step 4**: The replayed batch is processed on **Chain B**

### Impact


1. Duplicate Actions : Replayed batches could trigger the same action multiple times across chains, leading to financial losses or unintended state changes.

2. Systemic Risk : If exploited at scale, this vulnerability could disrupt the entire SEDA network and its supported blockchains.

In the current setup, a user executes an action on Chain A, triggering SEDA to process an associated request. The request is successfully executed, and the batch containing verified results is generated. If the protocol operates on Chain B, the user submits the same request along with the batch from Chain A. Due to differing conditions, the new request may yield a different output. However, since the batch lacks a chainId, it can be replayed across multiple chains, leading to  exploits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent batch replay attacks, the following measures should be implemented:

1. **Include `chainId` in Batch Structure**  
   Add a `chainId` field to the batch structure to explicitly tie the batch to a specific chain. This ensures that batches are only valid on their intended chain.

2. **Validate `chainId` During Batch Submission**  
   Modify the prover contract to validate that the `chainId` in the batch matches the expected chain ID. Reject batches with mismatched `chainId`.

 3. **Include `chainId` in Batch Hashing**  
   Ensure that the `chainId` is included in the hash calculation for the batch. This makes the hash chain-specific and prevents replay attacks.
