# Validators will not be able to sign first batch

### Summary

The check for a validator's presence in the validator Merkle tree of the *previous* batch will cause an error if the first batch is being processed.

### Root Cause

During signing the batch, in [`ExtendVoteHandler()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L101-L109) there is check for the validator being present in the validators tree of the previous (`batch.BatchNumber-1`) batch:

```golang
	_, err = h.batchingKeeper.GetValidatorTreeEntry(ctx, batch.BatchNumber-1, h.signer.GetValAddress())
	if err != nil {
		if errors.Is(err, collections.ErrNotFound) {
			h.logger.Info("validator was not in the previous validator tree - not signing the batch")
		} else {
			h.logger.Error("unexpected error while checking previous validator tree entry", "err", err)
		}
		return nil, err
	}
```

However, when the first batch is being processed, there is no previous batch, so `GetValidatorTreeEntry()` will return an error, causing an early exit from `ExtendVoteHandler()` without signing the batch.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Happens for the first batch only.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

See a Root Cause section.

### Impact

Validators will skip signing the first data batch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The simplest way is to skip this check if the first batch is being processed.
