# requestId has no unique parameters leading to different collisions

### Summary

The requestId parameter that's derived when posting a request is not unique and therefore can't be replicated again if needed or can be blocked by other users with front-running.

### Root Cause

Currently, the requestId that's obtained by calling `deriveRequestId()` cannot be sent again with the same parameters if needed (for instance, when dealing with data price feeds) and can be blocked as well leading to undesired behavior for the entity that tries to post it.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

An entity posts a data request on one of the supported chains.

### Attack Path

1) There can be a situation where the same data request with exactly the same input parameters is needed to be sent (when dealing with price feeds for example) but it can't be done as the one of the parameters is needed to be adjusted each time

2) Users who are interested in blocking a data request can infinetely front-run the transactions and block the data request posting (this could lead to a situation where some users benefit from the stale prices used in some other protocol that can't fetch the data)

### Impact

Data request collisions open up many attack surfaces including the situation where protocols can't fetch the data if an attacker decides to front-run them each time and blocking the requests (if there is a data request with the same id, the tx will revert)

### PoC

Consider the current requestId derivation process:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L122-139
```sollidity

   function deriveRequestId(RequestInputs memory inputs) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
        return
            keccak256(
                bytes.concat(
                    keccak256(bytes(SedaDataTypes.VERSION)),
                    inputs.execProgramId,
                    keccak256(inputs.execInputs),
                    bytes8(inputs.execGasLimit),
                    inputs.tallyProgramId,
                    keccak256(inputs.tallyInputs),
                    bytes8(inputs.tallyGasLimit),
                    bytes2(inputs.replicationFactor),
                    keccak256(inputs.consensusFilter),
                    bytes16(inputs.gasPrice),
                    keccak256(inputs.memo)
                )
            );
    }

```

So the requestId depends on each of this parameters. And if the same one already exists, the new request with the same params will be blocked:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/abstract/RequestHandlerBase.sol#L42-44
```solidity

     if (bytes(_requestHandlerStorage().requests[requestId].version).length != 0) {
            revert RequestAlreadyExists(requestId);
        }

```


First of all, there is no any nonce parameter in the requestId meaning the entity that posts a request has to always change them to make a new hash which damages user experience. The most serious impact though is an ability of malicious users to front-run the requests and always create a request with the same values as there is no `msg.sender` involved here. This leads to a situation where blockchains or users can't even post a request and this can be essential to the protocol if it depends on the external oracles and the data can't be fetched in time leading to stale state.

### Mitigation

Introduce some unique parameters like nonce and `msg.sender` address.
