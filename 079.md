# Data proxies will be paid unfairly if the gas for execution is insufficient

### Summary

Due to the lexicographical sorting order of data proxies' public keys, gas payout distribution may become unfair if the total gas is insufficient for all. Proxies with keys that appear later in the sorted array may not receive payment.

### Root Cause

In the [`EndBlock.go`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L196-L196) of `x/tally` module, proxies' public keys are sorted lexicographically:

```golang
	reveals := make([]types.RevealBody, len(req.Reveals))
	for i, k := range keys {
		reveals[i] = req.Reveals[k]
@>		sort.Strings(reveals[i].ProxyPubKeys)
	}
```

This order remains unchanged during tallying and gas distribution as we can see in `MeterProxyGas()` function in `gas_meter.go`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L73

If the gas allocated for execution is insufficient for all, it will lead to an unfair distribution where only the proxies that appear first in the array receive rewards.

It is worth noting that an insufficient gas situation can occur for various reasons, including:  
1) The user sets the gas value, and they may get it wrong.  
2) Any data proxy fee may increase between the data request and the result posting.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The gas setting is insufficient or becomes insufficient to cover expenses for all data proxies.

### Attack Path

1. A request was submitted.
2. A data proxy scheduled fee comes into force
3. During tallying, gas usage is calculated higher because of new fees, leaving some data proxies unpaid.

### Impact

Certain data proxies are more likely to be left without payment than others.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement randomization to prevent the same proxies from being disproportionately affected.
