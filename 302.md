# User will overpay for completed processing steps

#### Summary
The ability to arbitrarily increase fees in the `increaseFees` function will cause an unfair financial loss for requestors as they may unknowingly pay for processing steps that have already been completed. The contract does not track the current stage of request processing, allowing users to increase fees that will not impact the ongoing execution but will still be distributed when results are posted.

#### Root Cause
In[SedaCoreV1.increaseFees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206-L206), the contract allows users to increase fees (`additionalRequestFee`, `additionalResultFee`, `additionalBatchFee`) at any time without validating whether the respective processing step is still pending. Consequently, excess fees are distributed to involved parties regardless of whether they contributed to the processing under the increased fee structure.

[SedaCoreV1.postResult](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122-L122)

#### Internal Pre-conditions
1. **Requestor** submits a request with an initial fee.
2. **Nodes** process the request through multiple steps: request handling, batching, and result submission.
3. **Requestor** increases the fee via `increaseFees()` while being unaware of the processing stage.
4. **Processing continues or has already completed**, meaning the additional fee does not affect service execution but is still distributed.

#### External Pre-conditions
1. No external condition affects the ability of users to increase fees at any time.

#### Attack Path
1. **User** calls `increaseFees()` with additional fees.
2. **Processing nodes** continue execution, but some processing steps may already be completed.
3. **When posting results**, the increased fee is distributed to relevant parties, even though they performed their work based on the original fee.
4. **The requestor overpays for completed processing steps**, leading to an unfair financial loss.

#### Impact
The **requestor suffers a financial loss** due to paying additional fees that do not contribute to accelerating or improving the processing of their request. The involved processing nodes receive higher payments without performing additional work, creating an inefficient and potentially exploitable fee structure.

#### Recommended Mitigation
1. **Track processing stages**: Implement state tracking for each request to ensure fees can only be increased for pending processing steps.
2. **Refund excess payments**: During `postResult()`, check whether any increased fees were unnecessary and return them to the requestor.
