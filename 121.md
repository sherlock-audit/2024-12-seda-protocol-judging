# A Malicious Validator can crash SEDA chain nodes by submitting a vote extension shorter than 65 bytes

### Summary

The absence of a minimum length check in verifyBatchSignatures allows a malicious validator to submit a voteExtension shorter than 65 bytes, triggering a panic during signature verification when slicing voteExtension[:65]. This halts the chain for all participants.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go?plain=1#L383, the slice operation voteExtension[:65] assumes the voteExtension byte slice is at least 65 bytes long:
```go
sigPubKey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65])  // @audit no minimum length check
```
However, there is no minimum length check. If len(voteExtension) < 65, Go's runtime panics due to an invalid slice operation.

Vulnerable Code Context
The issue occurs within the verifyBatchSignatures function:

```Go
func (h *Handlers) verifyBatchSignatures(ctx sdk.Context, batchNum uint64, batchID, voteExtension, consAddr []byte) error {
    if len(voteExtension) > MaxVoteExtensionLength {
        h.logger.Error("invalid vote extension length", "len", len(voteExtension))
        return ErrInvalidVoteExtensionLength
    }

    // ... other code ...

    sigPubKey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65]) // Line 383
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // ... other code ...
}
```
The function checks for a maximum length (MaxVoteExtensionLength), but does not enforce a minimum length, making it vulnerable to short inputs.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Validator needs to be part of the active validator set to participate in consensus
2. Length of voteExtension needs to be less than 65 bytes but pass the MaxVoteExtensionLength check

### External Pre-conditions

None required - this is purely an internal vulnerability

### Attack Path

1. Malicious validator creates a vote extension of length < 65 bytes
2. The validator submits this malformed vote extension during the consensus
3. verifyBatchSignatures attempts to slice the first 65 bytes with voteExtension[:65]
4. Go runtime panics due to out-of-bounds array access
5. Panic in the consensus handler halts the chain

### Impact

The network participants cannot execute any transactions as the chain halts due to consensus failure. The attacker loses their staked tokens due to slashing but achieves a denial of service on the entire network.

Impact Matrix Box:

Category	                  Rating
Likelihood	          High
Impact	                  High
Complexity	          Low
Network Effect	  High

Explanation:
Likelihood: High - Any validator can easily trigger this by submitting a short vote extension
Impact: High - Can cause node crashes and potential chain halt
Complexity: Low - Simple to execute, requires no special tools or timing
Network Effect: High - Can affect multiple nodes simultaneously, potentially disrupting network consensus

### PoC
```go
func TestVulnerableSignatureVerification(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup minimal test environment
    ctx := sdk.NewContext(nil, false, nil) // Simplified for demo
    handlers := NewHandlers(
        dph,
        batchingKeeper,
        pubKeyKeeper,
        stakingKeeper,
        validatorAddressCodec,
        signer,
        logger,
    )
    
    // Create malicious vote extension of length < 65 bytes
    maliciousVoteExtension := make([]byte, 63) // Deliberately shorter than required 65 bytes
    
    // This will panic due to invalid slice operation
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r == nil {
            t.Fatal("Expected panic but none occurred")
        }
    }()
    
    err := handlers.verifyBatchSignatures(
        ctx,
        1,                      // batchNum
        []byte("testBatchId"), // batchID
        maliciousVoteExtension,// voteExtension (63 bytes)
        []byte("validatorAddr")// consAddr
    )
    
    // Should not reach here due to panic
    t.Fatal("Expected panic due to invalid slice operation, but got:", err)
}
```
Note: This code will panic when voteExtension[:65] is attempted on a 63-byte slice, as Go prevents slicing beyond a slice's length at runtime.

### Mitigation

Add a minimum length check before the slice operation:
```go
func verifyBatchSignatures(ctx sdk.Context, batchNum uint64, batchID, voteExtension, consAddr []byte) error {
    if len(voteExtension) < 65 {
        return fmt.Errorf("vote extension too short: %d bytes, expected at least 65", len(voteExtension))
    }
    if len(voteExtension) > MaxVoteExtensionLength {
        return ErrInvalidVoteExtensionLength
    }
    // Continue with existing logic...
}
```
This prevents the panic by rejecting malformed vote extensions early, maintaining chain stability.
