# Unchecked Gas Usage

 ## Summary
The SedaCoreV1 contract fail to validate that the reported gasUsed in a result does not exceed the gasLimit specified in the original request. This allow malicious executors to manipulate fee distribution by overreporting gas usage, potentially stealing funds or possible denial-of-service (DoS).

## Vulnerability details 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162-L167


As a request is submitted via postRequest, the total gas limit (gasLimit) is stored as:

`gasLimit: inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit`

Then when posting a result, the protocol calculates fees using:

`submitterFee = (gasUsed * requestFee) / gasLimit`

but there's no validation to ensure that gasUsed <= gasLimit.

the Fee Allocation Design when a request is created shows that ;

requestFee: Paid to executors proportional to gas used

Unused gas portion (gasLimit - gasUsed) is refunded to the requestor


## Proof of Concept
**Scenario:**

Requestor submit a request with:

execGasLimit = 50,000

tallyGasLimit = 50,000

gasLimit = 100,000

requestFee = 1 ETH

**Attack:**

Then the malicious executor submit a result with 'gasUsed = 150,000'
and the fee calculation is 

`submitterFee = (150,000 * 1 ETH) / 100,000 = 1.5 ETH`

but when the protocol attempt to refund :

`refundAmount += (1 ETH - 1.5 ETH)`
it will then revert due to underflow 


## Impact 
Valid result submission fail due to arithmetic underflow

Request becomes permanently stuck as honest requestors lose funds



## Recommendation 
Add explicit validation for gas usage
```solidity

function postResult(..
....) public ........ {
    RequestDetails memory requestDetails = _storageV1().requestDetails[result.drId];
    
    // Add validation
    if (result.gasUsed > requestDetails.gasLimit) {
        revert GasLimitExceeded(result.gasUsed, requestDetails.gasLimit);
    }
    
    
}
```
