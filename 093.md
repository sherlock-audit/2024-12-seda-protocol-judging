# If an encryption key is not provided, the keys are stored in plaintext

The code saves private keys to a JSON file. If an encryption key is not provided, the keys are stored in plaintext. This exposes highly sensitive data, which can lead to unauthorized access and potential fund loss if an attacker obtains these keys.
1. **Conditional Encryption in `[saveSEDAKeyFile](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/seda_keys.go#L166-L172):**

   ```go
   if encryptionKey != "" {
       encryptedData, err := encryptBytes(jsonBytes, encryptionKey)
       if err != nil {
           return fmt.Errorf("failed to encrypt SEDA keys: %v", err)
       }
       jsonBytes = []byte(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(encryptedData))
   }
   ```
   
   **Explanation:**  
   - The code checks if `encryptionKey` is non-empty.  
   - If it is non-empty: The JSON containing the private keys is encrypted and then base64-encoded.  
   - If it is empty: This block is skipped, meaning the keys remain in plaintext.
When `encryptionKey` is empty (for example, in development or if the environment variable isn’t set), the keys are written as plain JSON to disk. An attacker who gains file system access could read these keys directly, leading to unauthorized access and the possibility of signing transactions, which might result in fund theft or network disruptions.
2. **User Configuration Allowing Unencrypted Keys:**
the function [ShouldAllowUnencryptedSedaKeys](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/seda_keys.go#L36-L41)
   ```go
   func ShouldAllowUnencryptedSedaKeys(appOpts servertypes.AppOptions) bool {
       allowUnencryptedFlag := cast.ToBool(appOpts.Get(FlagAllowUnencryptedSedaKeys))
       _, allowUnencryptedInEnv := os.LookupEnv(EnvAllowUnencryptedSedaKeys)
   
       return allowUnencryptedFlag || allowUnencryptedInEnv
   }
   ```
provides a mechanism to allow unencrypted key storage via a flag or environment variable. This feature, even if intended for testing, could be accidentally or intentionally enabled in production, further exposing private keys.

## Root Cause:  
The bug occurs because the code only encrypts and protects the private keys if an encryption key is provided. If no encryption key is set (i.e., an empty string), the keys are saved as plain text.
```go
if encryptionKey != "" {
    encryptedData, err := encryptBytes(jsonBytes, encryptionKey)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to encrypt SEDA keys: %v", err)
    }
    jsonBytes = []byte(base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(encryptedData))
}
```
- The `if encryptionKey != ""` check means that encryption happens only when an encryption key exists.
- If `encryptionKey` is empty, this block is skipped, and the keys remain unencrypted.  
- Storing unencrypted keys can lead to unauthorized access if someone gains access to the file system.


### Impact:
  An attacker who accesses the file system can retrieve these unencrypted keys. With control over the validator’s private keys, the attacker can impersonate the validator or sign malicious transactions. Misuse of these keys can lead directly to unauthorized transfers or the signing of fraudulent transactions, resulting in the loss of funds.

## Mitigation:
Require that an encryption key is always provided when saving SEDA keys. In other words, enforce encryption by disallowing unencrypted storage in production environments.
