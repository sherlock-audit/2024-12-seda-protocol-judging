# Missing Admin Address Binding in Signature Verification for Data Proxy Registration

The [RegisterDataProxy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L33-L97) function constructs a payload for signature verification that omits the admin address, as shown in the code snippet below:

```go
feeBytes := []byte(msg.Fee.String())
payoutAddressBytes := []byte(msg.PayoutAddress)
memoBytes := []byte(msg.Memo)
payload := make([]byte, 0, len(feeBytes)+len(payoutAddressBytes)+len(memoBytes))
payload = append(payload, feeBytes...)
payload = append(payload, payoutAddressBytes...)
payload = append(payload, memoBytes...)
payload = append(payload, []byte(ctx.ChainID())...)
```

This payload is then hashed and used in the signature verification:

```go
if valid := secp256k1.VerifySignature(pubKeyBytes, crypto.Keccak256(payload), signatureBytes); !valid {
    return nil, types.ErrInvalidSignature.Wrap("Invalid data proxy registration signature")
}
```

By not including the admin address (`msg.AdminAddress`) in the payload, the signature does not bind the registration to a specific admin, allowing an attacker to provide a valid signature while arbitrarily setting the admin address. This misconfiguration results in a direct mismatch between the signed data and the stored configuration, undermining the contractâ€™s intended access control mechanism.

### Primary Root Cause:
The omission of the admin address from the signed payload in the registration process.

### Impact:
Since subsequent operations (e.g., [EditDataProxy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L119-L121) and [TransferAdmin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L206-L208)) rely on the stored `AdminAddress` for authorization, an attacker can manipulate or reassign control of the proxy. This misalignment could lead to unauthorized state changes or even the misdirection of fee payouts, potentially resulting in a loss of funds or significant disruption of service.
### Mitigation:
Include the admin address in the payload that is hashed and signed to ensure it is cryptographically bound to the registration.
