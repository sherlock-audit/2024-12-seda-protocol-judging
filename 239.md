# A jailed validator with no registered key blocks proving scheme activation

### Summary

When a proving scheme is ready for activation, all validators without registered keys will be jailed. However, there is no check
that a validator is currently jailed before jailing, which raises an error and causes the `EndBlock()` to return early without
activating the proving scheme. 

### Root Cause

- In Pubkey module's `EndBlock()`, a validator without keys will get [jailed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/pubkey/keeper/endblock.go#L135-L144) without first checking if it is already jailed.
- `slashingKeeper.Jail()` eventually calls [`jailValidator()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/x/staking/keeper/val_state_change.go#L309-L311), which returns an error when a validator is already jailed.
```golang
if validator.Jailed {
  return types.ErrValidatorJailed.Wrapf("cannot jail already jailed validator, validator: %v", validator)
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. A validator has no registered keys. It is [optional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/staking/keeper/msg_server.go#L65-L76) to register keys while the scheme is not activated.
2. This validator with no keys gets permanently Jailed for double-signing.
3. The Pubkey module's `EndBlock()` always [returns early](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/pubkey/keeper/endblock.go#L40-L43), because `JailValidators()` always fails.


### Impact

The Proving Scheme will not be activated at the configured activation height and will remain inactive while the validator is jailed
and has no registered key. A validator can be jailed permanently, leading to the Proving Scheme never getting activated.

A validator can prevent [batches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L36-L42) from ever getting produced because the SEDAKeyIndexSecp256k1 proving scheme never gets activated.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider checking first if the Validator is Jailed before jailing it.
