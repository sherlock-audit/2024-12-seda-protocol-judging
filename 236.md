# Memory leak when executing Tally VM

### Summary

There is a memory leak when executing Tally VM due to a C string not being freed, which leads to all validator nodes eventually crashing due to out-of-memory.

### Root Cause

- In [`tallyvm/executo.go::ExecuteTallyVM()#26-27`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/tallyvm/execute.go#L26-L27), memory is allocated for the C String `configDirC` but it is not freed. 
```golang
configDirC := C.CString(LogDir)
```

Note that `LogDir` is set in [`app.go::Init()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/app.go#L236-L237).
```golang
DefaultNodeHome = filepath.Join(userHomeDir, ".sedad")
tallyvm.LogDir = filepath.Join(DefaultNodeHome, "tally-logs")
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None

### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

The vulnerability will surface after many runs of `ExecuteTallyVM()`, which happens every `EndBlock()`. Eventually, so much memory is leaked that validators slow down and then crash due to out-of-memory. Note that `ExecuteTallyVM()` will run for almost every "tallying" data request.


### Impact

Validator nodes will eventually crash, which can lead to a chain halt or, at least, liveness slashing for all validators.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation

Consider freeing `configDirC` the same way the other C strings are freed.
