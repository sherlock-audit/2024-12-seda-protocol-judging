# Malicious users will bypass redelegation entry limits affecting blockchain state integrity

### Summary

The missing validation check in the TransferDelegation method will cause excessive state bloat for the blockchain network as malicious users will transfer delegations to circumvent maximum redelegation entry limits on recipient accounts.

### Root Cause

In [`seda-chain/x/staking/keeper/keeper.go`]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/staking/keeper/keeper.go#L48) ,the TransferDelegation, there is a missing check for maximum redelegation entries on the recipient side when transferring redelegation entries. While the code validates that the transfers won't exceed entry limits on the source account, it fails to perform the same validation for the destination account.

The specific issue is visible when comparing lines 166-190 (which only check if the source might exceed limits) with the implementation of TransferUnbonding ( line 295), which correctly implements the check:

```go
maxed, err := k.HasMaxUnbondingDelegationEntries(ctx, toAddr, valAddr)
if err != nil {
    return transferred, err
}
if maxed {
    break
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to have active delegations with at least one validator
2. The user must have performed redelegations that have pending completion periods
3. The destination account needs to already have redelegation entries close to the maximum limit (MaxEntries)
4. The `TransferDelegation` function must be called to move delegation shares between accounts

### External Pre-conditions

No specific external pre-conditions required to exploit this vulnerability.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates multiple destination accounts
2. Attacker delegates tokens to a validator from a source account
3. Attacker creates multiple redelegations from their source account to approach but not exceed the maximum redelegation entries limit
4. Attacker calls a function that invokes `TransferDelegation` to move delegation shares to a destination account that already has nearly the maximum number of redelegation entries
5. The transfer succeeds without checking the destination account's redelegation entry limit
6. Destination account now exceeds the MaxEntries limit intended by the protocol
7. Attacker repeats steps 4-6 with multiple destination accounts, creating an excessive number of redelegation entries in the blockchain state

### Impact

The blockchain network suffers from unintended state bloat as accounts can accumulate more redelegation entries than the protocol design intended. This increases storage requirements, validation time, and synchronization overhead for all network participants. The bypassing of this limit undermines a core protection mechanism designed to prevent denial-of-service attacks on the blockchain. While this doesn't directly lead to token theft, it compromises the network's performance, increasing gas costs and potentially making block production more resource-intensive over time.

### PoC

1. Create two accounts: Account A (source) and Account B (destination)
2. Delegate 1000 tokens from Account A to Validator X
3. Perform redelegations from Validator X to Validators Y1, Y2, ..., Yn with Account A until Account A has (MaxEntries - 1) redelegation entries
4. With Account B, perform redelegations until it has (MaxEntries - 1) entries
5. Transfer delegation shares from Account A to Account B using the vulnerable `TransferDelegation` method
6. Observe that Account B now exceeds MaxEntries limit
7. The blockchain state now contains more redelegation entries than intended by the protocol design

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `TransferDelegation` method to validate that the recipient account won't exceed the maximum redelegation entries limit:

```go
// Before transferring redelegation entries, check if recipient already has max entries
for _, redelegation := range redelegations {
    if redelegation.ValidatorDstAddress != valAddr.String() {
        continue
    }
    
    valSrcAddr, err := sdk.ValAddressFromBech32(redelegation.ValidatorSrcAddress)
    if err != nil {
        return transferred, err
    }
    valDstAddr, err := sdk.ValAddressFromBech32(redelegation.ValidatorDstAddress)
    if err != nil {
        return transferred, err
    }
    
    // Add this check similar to TransferUnbonding
    maxed, err := k.HasMaxRedelegationEntries(ctx, toAddr, valSrcAddr, valDstAddr)
    if err != nil {
        return transferred, err
    }
    if maxed {
        // Skip transferring this redelegation entry
        continue
    }
    
    // Proceed with the transfer...
}
```

This ensures consistency with the `TransferUnbonding` method and properly enforces the maximum redelegation entries limit on both source and destination accounts.
