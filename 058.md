# Funds for pending withdrawal can be stolen

### Summary

The issue stems from the fact that funds are sent to the message sender during withdrawal making it susceptible to signature reuse in case of transaction failure or by executing by malicious validator.

### Root Cause

In [`withdraw.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L35-L39), funds are sent to the message sender:

```rust
        // send the tokens back to the executor
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
@>          to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };
```

However, during signature verification, `info.sender` is not verified:

```rust
        // verify the proof
        let chain_id = CHAIN_ID.load(deps.storage)?;
        let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
        let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
        self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
```

This makes it susceptible to signature reuse in case an executor sends a withdrawal transaction but it fails or being front-run by a malicious validator.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Executor sends withdraw request
2. Malicious validator front-runs by using the same signature
3. Funds are sent to validator's controlled address

### Impact

1. Funds can be stolen (sent to the attacker's address)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate message sender as a part of signed data.
