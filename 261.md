# There is no entrypoint to call the evidence logic

### Summary

There is no msg server functions implemented to provide an evidence of double signing for the protocol.

### Root Cause

No function to externally call the handle evidence.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

Somebody wants to submit an evidence of double signing -> the call is blocked as there is no function to call

### Impact

DoS, functionality can't be used

### PoC

Take a look at the functionality:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L21-25
```go
func NewBatchDoubleSignHandler(keeper Keeper) func(ctx context.Context, evidence exported.Evidence) error {
	return func(ctx context.Context, evidence exported.Evidence) error {
		return keeper.handleEvidence(ctx, evidence.(*types.BatchDoubleSign))
	}
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L27
```go

func (k *Keeper) handleEvidence(ctx context.Context, evidence *types.BatchDoubleSign) error {

```

Both functions are related to the keeper and cannot be externally called.

### Mitigation

Introduce a msg server alike functionality to externally call the `handleEvidence()`.
