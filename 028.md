# Malicious requestor will exploit fee transfer vulnerability to withdraw protocol funds


### Summary 
In `SedaCoreV1.postRequest()` function, a malicious requestor can intentionally fail a transaction when the `refundAmount` is transferred back to the requestor. This failure, paradoxically, generates a legitimate proof that the attacker later reuses to validate the requested data and withdraw funds using `withdrawTimedOutRequest`.

### Vulnerability Details
```solidity
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
            _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```
`SedaCoreV1.postResult()` perform [push based fee distribution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L197), which could be exploited against the protocol to obtain the legitmate proof without paying an fees(e.g. request + refund + batch fee). 

Consider Alice request some data for her side project, she setup a smart contract that post requests on her behalf. Also the contract have conditional fallback logic that accept ETH only after `request.timestamp + timelockPeriod`, any transfer to the contract before this period will result in failure.

- The contract first calls [postRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L91) with a high `requestFee` value so that any excess fee gets refunded later.

- [On PostResult()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122), after it verify result using proof, it transfer `refundAmount` to requestor, but the txn fails due to the contract intentional reverts on receiving ETH before `request.timestamp + timelockPeriod`. And, as the failed transaction still contains legitimate proof, it can be used to verify the authenticity of the request data.

- After the `timelockPeriod` elapses, the requester can performs an immediate [`withdrawTimeOutRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L231) call, withdrawing any allocated fees for that request response. These fees are expected to remain secured by the protocol; however, they no longer are.


### Impact 
Direct loss of funds to solver/or batch sender.  

### Mitigation 
Switch to a pull payment system where fees are recorded and later claimed by the requestor.
