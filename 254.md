# A malicious validator can post arbitrary batches with just one signature

### Summary

Posting batches in the Prover contract requires [consensus](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L123-L125). However, this can be achieved by just one validator because uniqueness is not enforced in the list of signatures and signers.

### Root Cause

In [`Prover::postBatch():110-120`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L110-L120), no uniqueness checks are applied to the list of signatures and signers.

```solidity
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
      // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
      if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
          revert InvalidValidatorProof();
      }
      // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
      if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
          revert InvalidSignature();
      }
      votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
  }
```

This enables any validator to submit arbitrary batches by duplicating their own signature and public key as many times as needed to so they meet the consensus threshold.

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. Malicious validator calls Prover's `postBatch()` with an invalid batch a signatures list filled with their own signature  duplicated multiple times and a list `validatProofs` that includes their own public key as signer multiple times.
2. The `votingPower` will total `no. of signatures * validatorVotingPower` and it will meet the consensus threshold when enough signatures are duplicated.


### Impact

A malicious validator can submit any Batch of data result they want and also invalidate previous batches since they can exclude these batches from the `resultsRoot`.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider checking that the signatures and signers are unique in `postBatch()`.
