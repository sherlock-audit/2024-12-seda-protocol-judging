# Missing access control modifier in SedaCoreV1::increaseFees()

### Summary

According to the NatSpec of the  `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees()` ([link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206)) only the owner should be allowed to increase the fees for a pending request.

If the NatSpec is correct, then the function `increaseFees()` is missing the `onlyOwner` modifier which allows anyone to be able to call the function and increase the fees for a request.

### Root Cause

In seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:206 the `increaseFees()` function is missing the `onlyOwner` modifier to restrict the function being called only by the owner of the contract

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Unauthorized/Malicious user calls `increaseFees()` with parameters of his choice either picking a random `requestId` or targeting a specific one and increasing its fees

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Anyone can call the `increaseFees()` function with chosen parameters and modify the fees of a pending transaction

### Impact

Malicious users can increase the fees of any pending transaction, thus breaking the calculation of the fees and the costs of the transactions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adding `onlyOwner` Modifier to `increaseFees` function
