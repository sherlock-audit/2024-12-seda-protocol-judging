# `call_result_write` import can be exploited for unmetered execution and memory growth

### Summary

Unlike the other core Tally imports, [`call_result_write`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/core_vm_imports/call_result.rs#L17-L33) does not call [`apply_gas_cost`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/metering.rs#L92-L126) to charge the caller gas. Any attacker can exploit this issue to do unmetered execution or memory growth because there is no cost to the attacker. This impacts validators by draining their resources, whether CPU or memory, and can lead to chain delays or Chain Halts, in the worst case.

### Root Cause

In the [`call_result_write`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/core_vm_imports/call_result.rs#L17-L33) import, there is no call to `apply_gas_cost` unlike in the other [imports](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/core_vm_imports/execution_result.rs#L11-L14).

```rust
fn call_result_value(
    env: FunctionEnvMut<'_, VmContext>,
    result_data_ptr: WasmPtr<u8>,
    result_data_length: u32,
) -> Result<()> {
    // @audit apply_gas_cost() must be called at the start to apply metering
    let ctx = env.data();
    let memory = ctx.memory_view(&env);

    let target = result_data_ptr.slice(&memory, result_data_length)?;
    let call_value = ctx.call_result_value.read();

    for index in 0..result_data_length {
        target.index(index as u64).write(call_value[index as usize])?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

None


### Attack Path

1. The Attacker creates a WASM program that exploits the unmetered execution of `call_result_write`.
The program can either loop for as long as there is gas available (they only need to pay for the gas for the loop) or
set `result_data_length` to 100GB in length.
2. The Attacker then compiles the WASM program and deploys the binary via [`StoreOracleProgram()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/wasm-storage/keeper/msg_server.go#L34-L96).
3. The Attacker posts a Data Request that will execute their earlier deployed Tally Program.
4. Once the Data Request is for tallying, it will be processed in the Tally module's [`EndBlock()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L22-L41).
5. When [executing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L210) the Attacker's Tally Program, it either crashes all the validators that run it due to Out-of-Memory and cause a chain halt, or the unmetered execution delays block building significantly.


### Impact

Unmetered execution or memory growth will drain the resources of Validators, leading to chain delays or chain halts.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider calling `apply_gas_cost` in the `call_result_write` import to apply metering.
