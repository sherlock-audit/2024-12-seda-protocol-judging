# Wrong amount of gas will be used in a certain case

### Summary

Wrong amount of gas will be used in a certain case

### Root Cause

When executing the tally program during the end blocker, we call `gas_meter::MeterExecutorGasDivergent()` when the gas reports are not uniform. There, we have the following code:
```go
	for i, gasReport := range gasReports {
		executorGasReport := gasMeter.CorrectExecGasReportWithProxyGas(gasReport)
		adjGasReports[i] = min(executorGasReport, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
		if i == 0 || adjGasReports[i] < lowestReport {
			lowestReporterIndex = i
			lowestReport = adjGasReports[i]
		}
	}
```
We get the lowest report index and its respective gas report. Then, we have a special case upon going over the executors:
```go
		if i == lowestReporterIndex {
			gasUsed = lowestGasUsed
		}
		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForExecutor(executor, gasUsed)
```
We compute a special `lowestGasUsed` and use it for the gas consumption. However, this fails to account for the case where 2 of the gas reports are the same, in that case we will only use the lowest gas for the first one in the array, while the second (and every next one if any) will use the normal gas.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The gas reports are not all the same but there are 2 or more which are the same

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. There are 3 gas reports, `[10, 10, 20]`
2. The lowest report will be 10 and the index will be 0
3. The computed `lowestGasUsed` will only be applied for the first executor, even though the 1st index is also the lowest report, these are 2 such reports
4. Incorrect gas will be consumed

### Impact

Incorrect gas consumption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have an array of indices with the lowest gas report value and use the lowest gas value for each of them.
