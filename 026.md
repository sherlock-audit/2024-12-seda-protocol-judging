# Array Out-of-Bounds Risk

Array Out-of-Bounds Risk
Summary

In the ProcessProposalHandler function, a sub-array is directly sliced from req.Txs without checking its length, which may lead to array out-of-bounds.

Vulnerability Detail

When the proposal does not contain extended voting data, the req.Txs[1:] operation may cause an array out-of-bounds, triggering a runtime error.

Impact

Array out-of-bounds may cause the node to crash, affecting system availability.

Code Snippet

<GO>
req.Txs = req.Txs[1:] // Length of req.Txs not checked
Tool Used

Manual Review

Recommendation

Check the length of req.Txs before slicing the sub-array, for example:

<GO>
if len(req.Txs) < 1 {
    return ErrEmptyTxs
}
req.Txs = req.Txs[1:]
POC

func TestEmptyTxsPanic(t *testing.T) {
    req := &abcitypes.RequestProcessProposal{
        Txs: [][]byte{}, 
    }

    req.Txs = req.Txs[1:] 
}
