# Not including the sender in the signature verification upon data proxy registration is problematic

### Summary

Not including the sender in the signature verification upon data proxy registration is problematic

### Root Cause

Upon registering a data proxy, we have the following code:
```go
	payload := make([]byte, 0, len(feeBytes)+len(payoutAddressBytes)+len(memoBytes))
	payload = append(payload, feeBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, payoutAddressBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, memoBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, []byte(ctx.ChainID())...)

	if valid := secp256k1.VerifySignature(pubKeyBytes, crypto.Keccak256(payload), signatureBytes); !valid {
		return nil, types.ErrInvalidSignature.Wrap("Invalid data proxy registration signature")
	}
```
The issue is that the sender (the admin) is not included in the signature verification. This allows a malicious user to frontrun the data proxy registration with the same inputs, then he will take over the data proxy. He can also immediately edit the params afterwards, like change the fee or set a new payout address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No internal pre-conditions_

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. Bob will create a data proxy with certain params
2. Alice frontruns it with the same params, she is now the owner as the sender/admin is not included in the signature verification
3. Alice has successfully "stolen" the data proxy and can also edit its params any way she wants to

### Impact

Data proxy registrations can be perpetually disallowed and taken over.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the sender in the signature verification.
