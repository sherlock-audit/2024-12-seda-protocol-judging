# A malicious actor can perpetually DoS the legitimate `postRequest()` txn

### Summary
An attacker can front-run a transaction calling [`postRequest`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L91) with the exact same `RequestInputs` but with zero fees (`f1=f2=f3=0`). This results in an identical `requestId` being stored on-chain. Consequently, the legitimate userâ€™s transaction, which intended to create the same request with non-zero fees, reverts with `RequestAlreadyExists`. This blocks the user from establishing the request even after the proper fee funding.

### Vulnerability Details
Because `requestId` is [derived strictly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/abstract/RequestHandlerBase.sol#L41) from the `RequestInputs`(without incorporating fees), the two transactions with identical inputs yield the same requestId. A malicious user can spot a pending transaction in the mempool and quickly call `postRequest` with zero fees, occupying that `requestId` first. The attacker pays only gas costs, not the extra fees, yet still causes the legitimate request to revert once it arrives, as the contract sees a duplicate ID. This front-running leads to DoS attack, either the user must alter their inputs or is unable to post their intended request at all.

The griefer only has to pay the gas fee to place the `postRequest()` txn, but this cost is minimal. Since the contract is expected to deploy on multiple chains(see Readme), some of which have very low gas fees, raising the likelihood of this attack particularly there.

### Impacts
An attacker can perpetually DoS legitmate data requests from being placed. 

### Mitigation
There are two ways to fix it; 
1.) Along with `RequestInputs` params, the `requestId` should also consider or derive from the input requestFee, resultFee, and batchFee. 

2. Or simply ties the `requestId` to the `msg.sender`,  by including it in the `deriveRequestId()` function,   

> [!Note]  
> It should be categorized as high, since unlike other gas griefing attack in past, here the `postRequest` carries a critical component or the starting point of the Seda network. Breaking it, breaks the entire purpose of Seda here.
