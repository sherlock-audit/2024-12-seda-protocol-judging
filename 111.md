# Malicious actors will cause denial-of-service on low-TPS chains for SEDA protocol users

### Summary

A shared `batchHeight` across multiple chains can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) for slower chains (e.g., Ethereum) as a frontrunner on a high-TPS chain (e.g., Arbitrum, Base) can post a batch first, making legitimate batches from a slow chain invalid. The SEDA documentation does not clearly differentiate whether batchHeight and validators are shared across chains, and the current implementation does not enforce per-chain uniqueness.

### Root Cause

In [Secp256k1ProverV1.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L97-L99), the batch height validation only checks if the new batch height is greater than the last processed batch height without considering which chain the batch is being processed on:
```solidity
        // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
        if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
Additionally, the [deriveBatchId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L106-L160) function in SedaDataTypes.sol does not include chain-specific information:
```solidity
function deriveBatchId(Batch memory batch) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(
        bytes.concat(
            bytes8(batch.batchHeight),
            bytes8(batch.blockHeight),
            batch.validatorsRoot,
            batch.resultsRoot,
            batch.provingMetadata
        )
    );
}
```
Which means, validators can sign data on one chain and can be verified on other chains. This allowed frontrunning from faster L2 chains with low block-time to prevent valid batch submissions from slower L1 chains with high block-time.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- 66.67% of the validators that validated the results are still in the last validators Root.
- Chains like Arbitrum or Base have mined a batch height > the current batch height on EVM mempool (batch height - 1).

### External Pre-conditions

- There is a bad actor.
- Validators use the same batch ID and signatures across different chains.

### Attack Path

The bad actor monitors the SEDA protocol on a low block-time chain (e.g., Arbitrum, Base) where batches are processed quickly
The bad actor observes a new batch with height N being confirmed on Arbitrum, or Base
The bad actor identifies a lower block-time chain (Ethereum) that is still processing batches with heights less than N
Before the legitimate batch with height N - 1 reaches Ethereum, the attacker front-runs it by submitting the same batch data from Arbitrum to Chain Ethereum
The bad actor transaction is processed on Ethereum, updating the lastBatchHeight to N
When the legitimate batch with height N - 1 arrives on Ethereum, it is rejected because newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight
This creates a denial-of-service condition for Chain with low block-time, as it can no longer process the legitimate batch N - 1
The bad actor can be repeated for subsequent batches, effectively blocking the SEDA protocol's functionality on Chains with low block-time

### Impact

Suffer an approximate loss of all pending requests and associated fees on the affected chain. The attacker doesn't directly gain financially but achieves a denial-of-service attack that could be used for competitive advantages or as part of a larger attack strategy.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Clearly define whether validators and batch heights are chain-specific or shared across chains.

Enforce per-chain uniqueness by modifying SedaDataTypes to include chainId when computing signatures to prevent cross-chain signature reuse.
