# incorrect proof in verification code

### Summary

The tree navigation functions assume a standard heap layout, but the tree construction in buildTree places leaves in reverse order. This mismatch will lead to incorrect proofs.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/merkle.go#L48C1-L64C2

parentIndex calculates parent as (i - 1) / 2 which is standard for heap-like structures.
siblingIndex returns i - 1 for even indices and i + 1 for odd indices.
This assumes a different tree structure than what buildTree creates!
In the previous code, leaves were placed in reverse order, which affects the navigation logic.

The critical line is tree[len(tree)-1-i] = leaf. This places leaves in reverse order at the end of the array:
For example, with leaves [A, B, C, D]:

Tree array size is 2*4-1 = 7
Leaves are placed at: tree[6]=A, tree[5]=B, tree[4]=C, tree[3]=D
Then internal nodes are computed bottom-up

The parentIndex and siblingIndex functions assume a standard heap layout where:

For a node at index i, its parent is at (i-1)/2
For a node at index i, its sibling is at i-1 (if i is even) or i+1 (if i is odd)

When GetProof tries to find the proof path:

It correctly builds the tree using buildTree (with reversed leaf placement)
It finds the target leaf's position in the tree
It tries to navigate up the tree using siblingIndex and parentIndex

But the navigation functions assume a tree structure that doesn't match what buildTree created!

For example, if we're looking for the proof for leaf D (at tree[3]):

siblingIndex(3) returns 4, assuming C is the sibling
But the way buildTree constructs the tree, C might not actually be D's sibling!

This mismatch means the proof will contain the wrong nodes, resulting in a proof that cannot be verified against the correct root.

### Impact

This bug would cause GetProof to generate invalid proofs that fail verification, making the entire Merkle tree implementation unusable for its primary purpose of proving inclusion of specific entries.

### Mitigation

Modify buildTree to use standard heap layout, or
Modify the navigation functions to match the custom tree layout used in buildTree
