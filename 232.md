# Attacker can front-run any of the Staking messages and reuse the signature for any other Staking operation

### Summary

All three Staking messages (Stake, Unstake, Withdraw) use the same message hash (`hash(chain_id, contract_address, sequence)`) for their signatures. This allows attackers to front-run any of these messages with their own and reuse the signature.

### Root Cause

Signature verification uses the same message hash for all three Staking messages.
1. [Withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L13)
2. [Stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L14)
3. [Unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/unstake.rs#L13)

```rust
self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. Staker sends a Stake message to stake more tokens.
2. Attacker front-runs the Stake message and reuses its signature to Unstake all of the victim Staker's tokens.
3. Staker sends another Stake message to tokens since their earlier staking failed.
4. Attacker front-runs the Stake message and reuses its signature to Withdraw all of the victim Staker's tokens.


### Impact
The target Staker can permanently lose their staked tokens or their [eligibility](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L58-L65) to verify commits since they no longer meet the minimum stake.

### PoC
None

### Mitigation
Consider adding the operation the message hash of the signature so that the same signature can not be reused across different  Staking operations.
