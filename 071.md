# Any executor can execute any data request

### Summary

Executor subset partitioning is not enforced during the commit requests allowing any executor to bypass eligibility rules.

### Root Cause

In the [`is_eligible_for_dr.rs#L29-L42`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/state/is_eligible_for_dr.rs#L29-L42) there is a logic that defines a subset of eligible executors based on data request ID and executor index:

```rust
    let executor_index = Uint256::from(active_staker_index as u64);
    let executor_length = Uint256::from(all_active_stakers.len() as u64);

    let dr_index = Uint256::from_be_bytes(dr_id) % executor_length;
    let replication_factor = Uint256::from(data_request.replication_factor);
    let end_index = (dr_index + replication_factor) % executor_length;

    if dr_index < end_index {
        // No overflow case
        Ok(executor_index >= dr_index && executor_index < end_index)
    } else {
        // Overflow case
        Ok(executor_index >= dr_index || executor_index < end_index)
    }
```

That way, every executor can check whether it is eligible to execute any particular data requests by querying [`is_executor_eligible`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/query.rs#L58):

```rust
impl QueryHandler for is_executor_eligible::Query {
    fn query(self, deps: Deps, env: Env) -> Result<Binary, ContractError> {
        let (executor, dr_id, _) = self.parts()?;
        let executor = PublicKey(executor);

        // ... irrelevant code omitted ...

        Ok(to_json_binary(&is_eligible_for_dr(deps, dr_id, executor)?)?)
    }
}
```

However there is no corresponding check during [commit request](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts\contract\src\msgs\data_requests\execute\commit_result.rs#L13-L13) execution allowing executors to ignore subset rules and execute all requests or select them as they will.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An executor executes every possible request or pre-filters them to maximize profit.

### Impact

1. Executors' subset rules are ignored.
2. Executors can select requests to maximize profit and ignore other requests.
3. Some requests may not attract enough executors and stay unfulfilled / timeout.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce the executor's eligibility rule check during the commit request.
