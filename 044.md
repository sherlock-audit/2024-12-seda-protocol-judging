# Anyone can slow down or halt the chain by submitting a massive number of data proxy fee updates

### Summary

Data proxy registration is permissionless and does not incur fees (aside from transaction gas costs). As a result, anyone can create a massive number of fake proxies and trigger fee updates on all of them at once. This would initiate a resource-intensive operation later during updates processing in the EndBlock handler, significantly slowing down or even halting the chain.

### Root Cause

As we can see in [this code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L33-L97) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L33-L97, the data proxy registration process is permissionless and free, meaning anyone can create any number of data proxies at the expense of network gas fees only. The only requirement is to use unique public keys, which, by definition, is not a significant constraint.

Then [a fee update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L155) can be triggered on all these proxies at once, causing fee update requests to be scheduled for execution later in the EndBlock handler:

It is worth noting that there is no pagination or limit on the maximum number of requests to process hence the handler will try to pull and process everything at once causing the operation to be slow and require a large amount of RAM. This may result in the chain slowing down significantly or complete failure causing a DoS state. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

*None*

### External Pre-conditions

*None*

### Attack Path

1. An attacker registers 100,000 proxies
2. An attacker updates fees on all 100,000 proxies
3. After the fee update delay passes, the chain will try to process all updates at once

### Impact

Chain slow down or halt due to node failure.

### Mitigation

1. Introduce data proxy registration fees
2. Introduce a limit on how many fee updates can be processed at once
