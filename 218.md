# Reply Attack with Malicious Data on `postBatch` Function

## Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90

Attacker can submit new newBatch with malicious data and He can get signatures from and validator proofs from mempool but there is no validation/verification check with newBatch data or no check on msg.sender

## Explanation
The `postBatch` function is susceptible to a replay attack where an attacker can inject malicious data into a `newBatch`. Since the function does not validate the integrity of the `newBatch` data or verify the `msg.sender`, the attacker can exploit this to manipulate the system. 

    postBatch -> postRequest -> postReuslt -> getResult

first attacker has to invoke postBatch with malicious newBatch and then postRequest and then postResult no he can get exploitable oracle data
### Mitigation
Add validation logic to ensure the `newBatch` data is legitimate and conforms to expected formats.
