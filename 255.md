# The Seda Prover contract is permissionless but it is upgradeable

### Summary

According to the [SEDA docs](https://docs.seda.xyz/home/overview/seda-network-architecture/sedas-prover-contract):

> The SEDA Prover Contract is permissionless and can be deployed to any chain at any time

However, it is not permissionless because it is upgradeable by the owner.

### Root Cause

The SEDA Prover contract is [upgradeable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L21).

```solidity
contract Secp256k1ProverV1 is ProverBase, Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable {
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. Anyone deploys the Prover contract to an EVM chain.
2. As soon as there are some users, the owner of the Prover contract upgrades it to a version that steals or locks funds.


### Impact

An upgradeable contract is not permissionless and can be exploited by the owner to steal or lock funds.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider updating the docs or making the Prover contract immutable if SEDA wants to support permissionless deployments of the Prover contract.
