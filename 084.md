# Bad actors can register unlimited data proxies without financial commitment

### Summary

Malicious actors can register unlimited data proxies without financial commitment, enabling Sybil attacks that could lead to network centralization, economic manipulation, and degraded service quality.

### Root Cause

The data proxy registration process in [seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go:32](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L33) lacks any stake requirement or economic security mechanism. 
Anyone with a valid secp256k1 key pair can register as a data proxy without financial commitment, creating potential for Sybil attacks and misaligned incentives.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- no financial commitment or stake requirement for data proxy creators

### External Pre-conditions

- capability for data proxy creators to operate multiple data proxy instances simultaneously for coordinated attacks
- sufficient funds for data proxy creators to cover minimal transaction fees for multiple DataProxy registrations

### Attack Path

Preparation:
- Attacker generates numerous secp256k1 key pairs
- Sets up infrastructure to operate multiple data proxy instances

Execution:
- Registers multiple data proxies using different identities
- Distributes these proxies across different network locations to appear independent
- Initially operates proxies with competitive fees to attract users and gain market share

Exploitation:
- Once controlling a substantial portion of proxies, coordinates behavior across controlled nodes
- Implements strategic fee manipulation, service degradation, or selective censorship
- Potentially abandons underperforming proxies with no financial penalty

### Impact

- Network Centralization: false appearance of decentralization while actual control is concentrated

- Economic Manipulation: e.g. extraction of excessive profits during high-demand periods

- Service Degradation: 
  - inconsistent or unreliable service with minimal consequences for operators
  - strategic service denial during critical periods

- Data Privacy and Integrity Risks:
  - potential for monitoring and data collection across multiple entry points
  - selective data manipulation or censorship

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mandatory stake requirement for data proxy registration where operators must lock a significant amount of tokens as collateral. 

This stake should be:
- Subject to slashing for malicious behavior or service violations
- Locked for a minimum time period to prevent quick entry/exit attacks
