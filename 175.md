# Frontrunning postResult results in stealing the resultFee

### Summary

The lack of access control in `SedaCoreV1.postResult` allows anyone to frontrun a legitimate call and claim the `requestDetails.resultFee`, leading to a loss for the intended solver.  

### Root Cause

In `SedaCoreV1.postResult`, there is no restriction on who can call the function, allowing an attacker to frontrun a legitimate solver and claim the associated result fee.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A valid request with a nonzero `resultFee` exists in `_storageV1().requestDetails`.  

### External Pre-conditions

1. A legitimate solver attempts to call `postResult` to claim the fee.  

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate solver prepares to call `postResult`.  
2. An attacker observes the pending transaction and copies the calldata.  
3. The attacker submits the same call with a higher gas fee, frontrunning the legitimate solver.  
4. The attacker receives the `resultFee`, preventing the rightful solver from being rewarded.  

### Impact

The legitimate solver suffers a loss equal to `requestDetails.resultFee`, while the attacker gains the stolen fee. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement access control by restricting `postResult` to authorized solvers, such as those specified in the request details. Otherwise, include the `resultFeeReceiver` in the function's parameter and include it in the proof.
