# Malicious proposer can submit a request with no transactions to crash all validators

### Summary
All validator nodes will crash when they process a proposal from a malicious proposer that does not include any transactions due to
[accessing an index](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L250) in a slice that is out of range.

### Root Cause

In [abci/handlers.go:250](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L250), it is assumed that the request that comes from the proposer will always include at least one transaction. However, a malicious proposer can modify the proposing logic and submit a proposal with zero transactions. In effect, all validators that process the proposal will crash from an index out-of-range panic caused by the [following code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L250):

```golang
   if err := json.Unmarshal(req.Txs[0], &extendedVotes); err != nil {
```

Accessing the 0th index in an empty slice (`req.Txs`) will cause a panic.


### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. Malicious proposer modifies their `PrepareProposal()` handler to return an empty slice of transactions.
```golang
    return &abcitypes.ResponsePrepareProposal{
			Txs: [][]byte{}, // or nil
		}, nil
```
2. Every validator that processes this proposal with `ProcessProposal()` will crash.


### Impact

Chain halt, since all validators that process the proposal will crash.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider adding a check that `req.Txs` is not empty before accessing the first element of the slice.
