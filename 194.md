# Malicious user can hijack data proxy registrations through signature reuse

### Summary

Legitimate users wishing to register a data proxy will register their proxy through the MsgRegisterDataProxy message which is handled by the RegisterDataProxy function. This function has defect in that it allows un
a critical defect in signature validation will cause unauthorized data proxy admin access for all new proxy registrations as an attacker will intercept legitimate data proxy registration transactions and replace the admin address while reusing the original signature.


### Root Cause

In the data proxy models `msg_server.go`, the signature validation logic only includes fee, payout address, memo and chain ID in the payload, but omits the admin address:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/keeper/msg_server.go#L33

```go
	payload := make([]byte, 0, len(feeBytes)+len(payoutAddressBytes)+len(memoBytes))
	payload = append(payload, feeBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, payoutAddressBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, memoBytes...)
	payload = append(payload, []byte(ctx.ChainID())...)
```
This is a error, because the admin address has full control over the data proxy and is not part of the signed payload. This allows anybody to substitute their own admin address while using another entity's valid signature.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A legitimate data proxy owner creates a valid signature with their fee, payout address, memo and chain ID
2. The legitimate owner prepares a transaction to register their data proxy with this signature
3. The network's mempool contains the pending transaction with the valid signature which is viewable by a malicious user

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes a valid data proxy registration transaction in the mempool
2. Attacker copies all the transaction parameters, including the valid signature
3. Attacker creates a new transaction replacing only the admin address with their own address
4. Attacker submits this modified transaction with a higher gas price to front-run the legitimate transaction
5. Attacker's transaction is processed first and succeeds validation since signature verification doesn't check the admin address
6. The original legitimate transaction fails because the public key is already registered
7. Attacker now has admin privileges over the data proxy and can:
- Change the payout address to steal fees
- Modify the fee amount
- Transfer admin privileges to a different address

### Impact

The legitimate data proxy owner loses complete control of their service. The attacker gains unauthorized administrator access and can redirect all payment streams from the data proxy. This effectively steals the revenue stream from legitimate data proxy operators and compromises the integrity of the entire data proxy system. 


### Mitigation

Include the admin address in the signature payload
