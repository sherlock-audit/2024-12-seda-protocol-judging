# Malicious user may deny batch posting on EVM chain

### Summary

The issue stems from requiring each new batch height to be higher than the last posted. This can be exploited by posting an N+1 batch if several "to-be-posted" batches are available.

### Root Cause

In [`Secp256k1ProverV1.sol:L97`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L97-L97) a condition requires each posted batch height to be higher than previous one:


```solidity
        // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
@>      if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```

Typically, Cosmos SDK chains have around 5-8 seconds block times, and SEDA chain [has similar block times](https://staking-explorer.com/explorer/seda). On the other hand, Ethereum L1 block time is ~12 seconds, meaning that at least two result batches will be available to be posted in every Ethereum block.

These transactions to the `postBatch()` method may be reordered in a mempool naturally due to a difference in gas prices selected by different provers or can be exploited by a malicious attacker frontrunning the legitimate transaction. Eventually, it will lead to the second batch being reverted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Result batches are prepared in every block.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Destination EVM chain block time is higher than SEDA chain block time.

### Attack Path

00:00:00 - SEDA block is ready, and a result batch N is prepared
00:00:01 - Ethereum L1 block starts
00:00:02 - Prover posts the result batch N transaction to Ethereum L1
00:00:09 - SEDA next block is ready, a result batch N + 1 is prepared
00:00:10 - Prover posts the result batch N + 1 transaction to Ethereum L1
00:00:11 - Attacker posts frontrunning transaction of N + 1 with the gas price higher than 1st and 2nd ones
00:00:13 - Ethereum L1 block ends, attacker's transaction of N + 1 is executed first, a transaction of posting N result will be reverted

There exists a variation of this attack path when an attacker prepares the transaction directly using SEDA chain data, thus not waiting for the prover's one to appear in the mempool.

Additionally, even if `postBatch()` will be made permissioned to be called by the approved provers only, this issue still can happen naturally due to gas price differences or triggered by a malicious Ethereum validator.


### Impact

1. The batch cannot be delivered, therefore request results cannot be posted either. Fees will be refunded to the requestor eventually.
2. The validator's root may become stale as well, this can affect future batch posting when validator signatures and voting power are verified.
3. The issue may become more severe or be possible on other, faster chains as SEDA block time gets reduced.
4. Loss of gas fees for solvers accumulating over time.

### PoC

Please see the attack path section

### Mitigation

* Allow unordered batch posting, tracking for the posted batches by ` _storageV1().batches[newBatch.batchHeight].sender != address(0)`
* Do not update `lastValidatorsRoot` in case older batches are posted
