# Gas will be capped at a wrong value due to an incorrect variable usage

### Summary

Gas will be capped at a wrong value due to an incorrect variable usage

### Root Cause

When processing tallies, we have the following piece of code:
```go
		if len(req.Commits) < int(req.ReplicationFactor) {
                         ...
			MeterExecutorGasFallback(req, params.ExecutionGasCostFallback, gasMeter)
		}
```
If the commits are not enough to reach consensus, we will call `MeterExecutorGasFallback()` where we have the following code:
```go
	gasLimitPerExec := gasMeter.RemainingExecGas() / uint64(req.ReplicationFactor)
	for _, committer := range committers {
                 ...
		gasUsed := min(gasLimitPerExec, gasCostFallback)
		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForExecutor(committer, gasUsed)
	}
```
The `gasLimitPerExec` is used as a cap to the gas usage for each committer. However, the calculation uses an incorrect value as in this case, as shown above, the commits are __less__ than the replication factor. Thus, we are dividing by a value larger than the actual commits, resulting in an incorrect gas limit per each iteration.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The commits are insufficient for consensus

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

1. The replication factor is 5, there are 2 commits and the `execGasRemaining` is 50
2. The limit for each iteration is `50 / 5 = 10` even though there are only 2 commits, the calculation should be `50 / 2 = 25`
3. The gas used will be much lower than supposed to, resulting in an incorrect gas consumption

### Impact

Incorrect gas consumption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When the committers are less than the replication factor, divide by the amount committers instead of the replication factor.
