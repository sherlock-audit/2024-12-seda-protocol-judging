# Attacker can frontrun unstake calls to manipulate withdrawals

### Summary

The unstake function in `unstake.rs` verifies proof using `self.public_key` instead of `info.sender`. This allows an attacker to frontrun a legitimate user's unstake transaction and execute it with the public key of the staker, causing unintended withdrawals for the original staker.  

### Root Cause

In `unstake.rs`, the function verifies the proof using `self.public_key` rather than `info.sender`, enabling malicious actors to exploit frontrunning opportunities.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A staker has staked tokens in the protocol.  
2. A staker initiates an `unstake` transaction.  

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker observes the pending `unstake` transaction in the mempool. 

### Attack Path

1. The legitimate staker submits an `unstake` transaction.  
2. The attacker sees the transaction and submits a similar one with a manipulated `public_key`, frontrunning the original.  
3. The attacker’s transaction is processed first, altering the staked balance before the original transaction executes.  
4. Resulting in an incorrect withdrawal amount.  

### Impact

The affected staker may unstake an incorrect amount—either more or less than intended—due to transaction manipulation, leading to financial loss or incorrect state updates in the protocol.    

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `info.sender` instead of `self.public_key` for proof verification, ensuring that the unstake request is only valid for the sender's account and preventing transaction hijacking.
