# Unbounded Iteration in Eligibility Check Leading to Potential Denial-of-Service

In the [is_eligible_for_dr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/state/is_eligible_for_dr.rs#L6-L43) function, the contract iterates over the entire stakers list to filter active stakers by executing the following code block:  
```rust
let stakers = STAKERS.stakers.range_raw(deps.storage, None, None, Order::Ascending);
let all_active_stakers = stakers
    .filter_map(|stakers_info| {
        if let Ok((public_key, staker)) = stakers_info {
            if staker.tokens_staked >= config.minimum_stake_for_committee_eligibility {
                return Some((public_key, staker));
            }
        }
        None
    })
    .collect::<Vec<(Vec<u8>, Staker)>>();
```  
This block collects every staker that meets the minimum staking requirement into a vector without any bounds or pagination, meaning that if the number of stakers grows large, the function will consume excessive gas or computational resources during each invocation, thereby failing or significantly delaying transactions. This is a concrete vulnerability since any party can register a large number of stakers, forcing the contract to perform an unbounded iteration over a massive dataset every time `is_eligible_for_dr` is called.

#### Root Cause
 The absence of any limit or pagination mechanism in the iteration over the stakers list leads to unbounded processing, which directly results in excessive resource consumption during eligibility checks.

#### Impact
The immediate impact is that legitimate transactions invoking `is_eligible_for_dr` could fail due to gas exhaustion, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

#### Mitigation
Introduce pagination or an efficient indexing mechanism to limit the number of stakers processed per call.
