# Anyone can call increaseFees due to missing check

### Summary

the function `increaseFees` Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request, as noted in the interface.

```solidity

    /// @inheritdoc ISedaCore
    /// @dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }

        RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
        if (details.timestamp == 0) {
            revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        }

        details.requestFee += additionalRequestFee;
        details.resultFee += additionalResultFee;
        details.batchFee += additionalBatchFee;

        emit FeesIncreased(requestId, additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee);
    }
```

### Root Cause

the issue is that there is no check to ensure that only the owner can increase the fees. A malicious user can call the function and increase the fees of any `requestId`

### Internal Pre-conditions

No preconditions.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions.

### Attack Path

Malicious user calls the function and increases the fees.

### Impact

1. Invariant broken: only the owner should be able to increasefees
2. Any user will be able to increase the fees for a pending request

### PoC

No PoC needed

### Mitigation

Add an onlyowner modifier.
