# DataProxy owner can place JS code to memo field and inject code into users' web browser

### Summary

Malicious actors can register data proxies with XSS payloads in the memo field that will execute arbitrary JavaScript when rendered in frontend applications, potentially leading to account compromise and data theft.

### Root Cause

The data proxy memo field undergoes insufficient validation, with only length checks (max 3000 chars) and no content sanitization. 
Despite documentation stating the memo is "not used by the protocol," it's stored on-chain and included in events that may be consumed by web interfaces.

In [seda-chain/x/data-proxy/types/proxy_config.go:11](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/data-proxy/types/proxy_config.go#L11):
```go
func (p *ProxyConfig) Validate() error {
	// @audit: missing memo sanitization

	if len(p.Memo) > MaxMemoLength {
		return sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrapf("invalid memo length; got: %d, max < %d", len(p.Memo), MaxMemoLength)
	}

	return nil
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The attacker must be able to register a data proxy and set a memo.
- The attacker needs sufficient permissions to:
  - Generate a valid secp256k1 key pair
  - Create a valid signature for the registration message
  - Pay any transaction fees required for registration

### External Pre-conditions

The memo field must be rendered in a frontend application that:
- Displays the memo content to users
- Renders the content without proper sanitization or escaping
- Executes JavaScript in the context of the application

### Attack Path

Preparation: 
- Attacker generates a secp256k1 key pair
- Attacker crafts a malicious memo containing JavaScript code (e.g., <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')"> or more sophisticated payloads)

Exploitation:
- Attacker submits a MsgRegisterDataProxy transaction with the malicious memo
- The transaction is validated and included in the blockchain
- The memo is stored unsanitized in the data proxy configuration

Execution:
- When users access the frontend application that displays data proxy information
- The application renders the memo field directly in the DOM
- The browser interprets and executes the embedded JavaScript code

### Impact

- Session Hijacking: Attackers could steal authentication cookies or session tokens
- Credential Theft: Malicious JavaScript could create fake login forms to capture credentials
- API Key Exposure: Access to sensitive API keys or tokens stored in browser storage
- Data Exfiltration: Unauthorized access to sensitive data displayed in the application

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Use sanitizer to purge unsafe HTML/JS from memo, e.g. https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday
- Since documented as unused, remove logic related to propagating memo to events.
