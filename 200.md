# Malicious requestor can prevent relayer from receiving fees

### Summary

When request is resolved, user that created the request will pay 3 different fees - to a resolver, submitter (relayer), and batch sender:
```solidity
        uint256 requestFee,
        uint256 resultFee,
        uint256 batchFee
```
Submitter fee is calculated based on `requestFee` - the larger the fee amount, the greater the incentive for a relayer to forward certain request to the SEDA network.
```solidity
   - **Incentives**: Users attach a `requestFee` which is used to forward requests to the SEDA network.
```
But malicious requestor can prevent relayer from receiving fees and withdraw whole `requestFee` instead.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162)
Submitter fee is calculated as portion of `requestFee` based on used gas - if used gas is greater than gas limit - function reverts due to underflow, and this is corrects, because `requestFee` is not big enough to cover fees, so gas limit prevents user from overpaying.
```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
```
The issue is that user can set gas limit at big enough values to force fee calculation to round down to zero. Relayer will receive 0 fees even if `requestFee` is big enough to cover `gasUsed`, because fee is calculated based on `gas used`/`gas limit`, and this proportion can be manipulated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Requestor must set `gasLimit` at too big values.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Amelie creates request with `requestFee` = 0.05 ETH, `gasLimit` = type(uint256).max, meaning any gas used for execution is acceptable;
2. Relayer forwards the request to SEDA network, `gasUsed` = 0.04 ETH;
3. Relayer expects to receive at least 0.04 ETH back when result will be posted, but receives 0:
```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit = 0.04 ETH * 0.05 ETH / type(uint256).max = 0;
```
4. Amelie receives result and full `requestFee`.

### Impact

Relayer will receive 0 fees even if `requestFee` is big enough to cover `gasUsed`.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Recommended to use only `requestFee` to calculate `submitterFee`, because it also can be used as gas limit - if gas used is < than `requestFee`, send exact amount back to relayer, any remaining `requestFee - gasUsed` refund to requestor, if not - revert.
