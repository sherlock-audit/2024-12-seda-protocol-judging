# Insufficient Validation in `PrepareProposalHandler` Allows Malicious Transaction Batches, Risking Fund Loss and Consensus Disruption

In `appabci.NewHandlers`, specifically in the [PrepareProposalHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/app.go#L1025) or vote extension handlers (`ExtendVoteHandler`, `VerifyVoteExtensionHandler`). These handlers are tied to the `BatchingKeeper` and interact with the consensus process, which is critical for transaction inclusion and validator agreement.
## Bug Description
The bug stems from insufficient validation of batched transactions or signatures in the `PrepareProposalHandler`. In Cosmos SDK v0.47+, the `PrepareProposal` handler selects transactions for a block proposal. The SEDA chain customizes this handler to support batching, as evidenced by:
```go
abciHandler := appabci.NewHandlers(
    defaultProposalHandler,
    app.BatchingKeeper,
    app.PubKeyKeeper,
    app.StakingKeeper,
    authcodec.NewBech32Codec(sdk.GetConfig().GetBech32ValidatorAddrPrefix()),
    signer,
    app.Logger(),
)
app.SetPrepareProposal(abciHandler.PrepareProposalHandler())
```
The `BatchingKeeper` aggregates transactions (potentially including fund transfers or staking operations) into batches. If the `PrepareProposalHandler` fails to:
- Individually validate each transaction in the batch for signatures, permissions, or balances, or
- Ensure batch integrity (e.g., preventing replayed or malformed transactions),
an attacker could craft a malicious batch containing unauthorized fund transfers (e.g., via `BankKeeper.SendCoins`) or invalid state changes (e.g., slashing or staking operations). Since the handler is part of the consensus process, a flawed proposal could be accepted by validators, leading to loss of funds or disruption of service.
## Evidence and Context
 The [BatchingKeeper](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/app.go#L669-L679) integrates with StakingKeeper, SlashingKeeper, WasmKeeper, and BankKeeper, suggesting batches may involve fund movements or validator operations.
The `PrepareProposalHandler` directly affects what transactions are proposed. A bug here bypasses standard `AnteHandler` checks applied during transaction execution, as `PrepareProposal` operates at the consensus level. The ABCI handlers for the SEDA chain facilitate batch signing and validation, in the [PrepareProposalHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L177), by injecting unverified vote extensions, the system risks consensus failures, denial of service, or even fund loss due to a malicious proposer. Pre-validating vote extensions before injection, enforcing a canonical set, and improving monitoring can mitigate this issue, ensuring the chain’s consensus process remains robust and secure.

## Impact
 An attacker submits a batch with a transfer moving funds from an account they don’t control. If validation is lax, validators include it in the block, executing the transfer.
 Invalid batches (e.g., conflicting state changes) could cause validator disagreements, leading to forks or halting.
## Mitigation
Ensure `PrepareProposalHandler` calls `AnteHandler` or equivalent checks on each batched transaction.
Add a cryptographic commitment (e.g., Merkle root) to batches, verified during proposal construction.
