# Sequence Number Increment Precedes Signature Verification, Allowing DoS via Nonce Exhaustion

In the staking execution function, the sequence number is incremented before the transaction's signature is verified, [as shown by the code snippet below](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L13-L14):

```rust
let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
```

This ordering directly causes the contract to increment the nonce even when the signature verification fails, which leads to an incorrect sequence state. Consequently, any transaction that fails signature verification still consumes a valid sequence number, thereby disrupting subsequent legitimate transactions by forcing them to use a mismatched sequence. This implementation flaw undermines the contract's ability to reliably validate transactions, as the sequence number no longer accurately represents the transaction history for the staker.

**Primary Root Cause:** The core issue is the improper sequencing of operations where the nonce (sequence number) is incremented prior to signature verification, causing invalid transactions to alter the state by consuming a valid sequence number.

**Impact:** This flaw results in a clear and immediate Denial of Service (DoS) where attackers can repeatedly submit transactions with invalid signatures to exhaust the sequence number, preventing valid staking operations.

**Mitigation:** Verify the signature before incrementing the sequence number to ensure that only valid transactions consume a nonce.
