# Inconsistent Batch Signing Validation Allows Retrieval of Unsigned Batches

In the [Batch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/querier.go#L28-L53) query function, the contract [checks for a zero value of `BatchNumber` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/querier.go#L33-L34) to return the latest signed batch via `GetLatestSignedBatch`, but when a non-zero batch number is provided it directly calls `GetBatchByBatchNumber` without verifying that the batch is signed. For example, the code snippet 
```go
	if req.BatchNumber == 0 {
		batch, err = q.Keeper.GetLatestSignedBatch(ctx)
	} else {
		batch, err = q.Keeper.GetBatchByBatchNumber(ctx, req.BatchNumber)
	}
```
 lacks a validation step for non-zero batch numbers, leading to potential retrieval of unsigned batches that may not be finalized. This discrepancy in logic means that users can obtain sensitive, unfinalized batch data, bypassing the safeguards present in the latest signed batch retrieval process, and thus exposing the contractâ€™s state to unauthorized inspection.

## Root Cause
Failure to apply consistent signed batch validation in the non-zero batch number path.

## Impact
 Exposure of unfinalized batch data can lead to unauthorized access and potential manipulation of critical state information.

## Mitigation
 Enforce a signed batch verification on all batch retrieval functions regardless of the input parameters.
