# Chain can deadlock due to no consensus because too many validators changed signatures

### Summary

Validators that changed their batch signing keypair will not have their vote extensions counted for 1 block.

A validator's current batch signature pubkey must match the pubkey of their entry in the previous batch. Otherwise, their vote extension will not be accepted. 

When the following condition is true:

```pseudocode
SumOfChangedSignaturesPower > 1/3 TotalVotingPower
```

`PrepareProposal()` and `ProcessProposal()` will always fail when [validating vote extensions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L193) and cause a chain halt.

### Root Cause

An active validator's vote extension will not be accepted when their current signature's pubkey does not match the pubkey in their entry in the previous batch.

```golang
// ... snip ...
  valEntry, err := h.batchingKeeper.GetValidatorTreeEntry(ctx, batchNum-1, valOper)
  if err != nil {
    if errors.Is(err, collections.ErrNotFound) {
      if len(voteExtension) == 0 {
        return nil
      }
      return ErrUnexpectedBatchSignature
    }
    return err
  }
  // ETH address from previous batch's entry
  expectedAddr = valEntry.EthAddress
}

// sigPubkey = current batch signature pubkey
sigPubKey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65])
if err != nil {
  return err
}

// ethAddress from current signature's pubkey
sigAddr, err := utils.PubKeyToEthAddress(sigPubKey)
if err != nil {
  return err
}

// signature's address must match the address from previous batch's entry
if !bytes.Equal(expectedAddr, sigAddr) {
  return ErrInvalidBatchSignature
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
1. Multiple validators changed their signatures in the same block.


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. All the vote extensions of validators with changed signatures are not submitted, which makes up for more than 1/3 of total voting power.
2. When the proposal is [Prepared](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L193) or [Processed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L256), `ValidateVoteExtensions()` will always fail because it [requires consensus](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L143-L149) on vote extensions.


### Impact
Chain halt because consensus will always fail on vote extensions no matter the proposer.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider modifying `ValidateVoteExtensions()` and filtering out the validators with changed signatures from being counted for [TotalVotingPower](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L83).
