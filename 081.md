# Requester may prevent result posting at will to collect fees back after timeout

### Summary

A data requester may prevent result posting at will which will lead to the loss of fees for the solver and batch poster.


### Root Cause

In [`SedaCoreV1.sol:197`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L197) the residue from fees is sent back to the data requester:

```solidity
        // Aggregate refund to requestor containing:
        // - unused request fees (when gas used < gas limit)
        // - full request fee (when invalid payback address)
        // - batch fee (when no batch sender)
        if (refundAmount > 0) {
@>          _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
        }
```

Since this is a native ETH transfer, a data requester can use a smart contract to post data requests and arbitrarily control (enable/disable) data result delivery.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Unused request fee > 0 (when gas used < gas limit)

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user posts a new data request via a smart contract 
2. A solver node delivers the data request to the SEDA network where the processing starts
3. After some time (but before data results were delivered) a user decides that they no longer need data results and activates reverts on the requestor smart contract
4. A solver node cannot deliver data results as the transaction reverts
5. After timeout passed, a user calls withdraw and collects all fees back

### Impact

1. Users can force requests to timeout.
2. Solvers and batch poster lose fees.

Additionally, users may exploit this attack to disrupt the system by submitting such requests at scale. The `requestId` existence check is not a limiting factor, as attackers can generate unique `requestId`s simply by modifying the `memo` field.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the pull pattern for fee delivery.
