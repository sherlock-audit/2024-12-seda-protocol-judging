# Errors in TransferDelegation / TransferUnbonding Calls Are Silently Swallowed, Leading to Inconsistent State

### Summary

Swallowing (i.e., ignoring) internal errors in TransferDelegation and TransferUnbonding can cause partial and inconsistent state updates for all stakers and the ClawbackVestingAccount. Specifically, an attacker or any caller can trigger an internal error in these transfer functions, thereby bypassing the normal rollback mechanism and leaving the chain in a partially updated state.

### Root Cause

1. In the `keeper/keeper.go` file, within the `TransferDelegation` function, if an internal call (e.g., `k.GetValidator(ctx, valAddr)` or `k.SetDelegation(ctx, delTo)`) returns an error, the code does not propagate the error (i.e., `return err`). Instead, it uses `return transferred, nil`, effectively swallowing the error.
2. The same issue exists in the `TransferUnbonding` function. When an error occurs, instead of throwing an `error` that would trigger a rollback, the function returns `return transferred, nil`, failing to propagate the error upwards.

Since **Clawback** relies on these two functions to transfer shares/unbonding from the Vesting account to the Funder, it expects a rollback if there is an error (it only rolls back if `if err != nil { return nil, err }`). When `TransferDelegation` or `TransferUnbonding` swallow their internal errors, `Clawback` sees no error and thus cannot roll back the earlier updates, leaving the chain in a partially updated state.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A **malicious or unintentional caller** invokes `MsgClawback`, initiating the `Clawback` function.
2. Inside `Clawback`, the following calls are made in sequence:
    - `TransferUnbonding(ctx, vestingAccAddr, funderAddr, valAddr, ...)`
    - `TransferDelegation(ctx, vestingAccAddr, funderAddr, validatorAddr, ...)`
3. Within `TransferUnbonding` or `TransferDelegation`, if any operation fails (e.g., a failing hook, `SetDelegation` error, or a redelegation entry issue), an actual error is triggered—but instead of propagating that error, these functions return `(transferred, nil)`.
4. Since `Clawback` sees `err == nil`, it proceeds and ultimately returns “success.” The transaction is committed on-chain, but only a portion of the state has been updated (including changes to the `Clawback` account’s `EndTime`), and the necessary rollback never occurs, resulting in **inconsistent on-chain state**.

### Impact

- **Affected Parties**:
    - The ClawbackVestingAccount’s fund and stake records
    - All relevant validators and stakers, as they may subsequently read inconsistent delegation or unbonding states
- **Consequences**:
    - **Inconsistent State**: Certain delegation/unbonding data might be updated while other parts remain out of sync.
    - **Incorrect Unlocking of Funds**: The vesting account may be prematurely marked as unlocked even though funds were not fully transferred or redelegations were not handled correctly.
    - **Subsequent Operation Failures**: Later actions might fail due to missing or incorrect delegation/redelegation data, leading to errors in distribution or reward calculations.
    - **Potential Asset Risks**: In specific scenarios (for example, if an attacker controls a hook’s logic), funds could be double-counted, or certain locking states might be invalidated, resulting in further financial loss.

Overall, this vulnerability breaks fundamental atomicity and consistency guarantees on-chain and should be considered **high-severity**.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

1. **In `TransferDelegation` and `TransferUnbonding`, return `return transferred, err` whenever an error occurs.** Avoid returning `(transferred, nil)` if an actual error has been triggered.
2. Clearly distinguish normal conditions (e.g., “no items found” resulting in no-op) from true errors. Do not conflate these cases.
3. Ensure that the `Clawback` function is capable of detecting any errors, allowing the Cosmos SDK to roll back all write operations on failure and preserving transaction atomicity.
