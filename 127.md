# A validator can avoid the slashing, jailing, and tombstoning mechanisms intended for double signing by simply rotating its key

The issue stems from how the contract verifies a validator’s signature on a fraudulent (double-signed) batch. Instead of checking the signature against the validator’s current key, it compares it to the key stored from the previous batch. This creates a loophole if a validator rotates its key between batches.
The function [recoverEthAddressFromSecp256k1Signature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L143-L160) recovers an Ethereum address from the signature provided with the double-sign evidence. It uses the fraudulent batch’s ID as the message:
   ```go
   func (k *Keeper) recoverEthAddressFromSecp256k1Signature(batchID []byte, signature string) ([]byte, error) {
       signatureBytes, err := hex.DecodeString(signature)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       signaturePubkey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, signatureBytes)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       signatureAddr, err := utils.PubKeyToEthAddress(signaturePubkey)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       return signatureAddr, nil
   }
   ```
   This recovered address (`signatureAddr`) represents the key that was used in the fraudulent (current) batch.

The function [getEthAddressForBatch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L162-L174) is used to retrieve the validator’s Ethereum address, but it does so based on historical data from **batchNumber - 1**:
   ```go
   func (k *Keeper) getEthAddressForBatch(ctx context.Context, batchNumber uint64, operatorAddr string) ([]byte, error) {
       operatorAddrBytes, err := k.validatorAddressCodec.StringToBytes(operatorAddr)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       validatorEntry, err := k.GetValidatorTreeEntry(ctx, batchNumber, operatorAddrBytes)
       if err != nil {
           return nil, err
       }

       return validatorEntry.EthAddress, nil
   }
   ```
   Here, the system assumes that the validator’s key does not change between batches.

   After recovering the address from the fraudulent evidence and retrieving the historical address, the code compares the two:
   ```go
   if !bytes.Equal(validatorEthAddr, signatureAddr) {
       return fmt.Errorf("recovered address does not match validator entry. Recorded: %s, Got: %s",
           hex.EncodeToString(validatorEthAddr), hex.EncodeToString(signatureAddr))
   }
   ```
   The check expects the recovered address to match the stored address from the previous batch.

## Root Cause and How It Manifests

The critical flaw is that the system **does not account for key rotation**. If a validator updates its Ethereum key between batches (from batch _N-1_ to batch _N_), the recovered address from the fraudulent batch (using the new key) will not match the address fetched from the previous batch (which still holds the old key). This discrepancy means that even if a validator has double-signed, the evidence check will fail because the signature does not match the historical record, and the double-sign evidence is effectively ignored.

## Impact
A validator can avoid the slashing, jailing, and tombstoning mechanisms intended for double signing by simply rotating its key. Since the mechanism is designed to secure the network against double signing, bypassing it can lead to significant service disruption and financial risk.

## Mitigation

The verification process should:
- Compare the recovered address against the current validator key at the time of the fraudulent batch, or
- Ensure that the stored validator key is updated in a way that reflects any legitimate key rotations, making the comparison accurate.
