# Gas free messages can be used to DoS the network

### Summary

The AnteHandler allows gasless cosmosWASM calls to the core contract for the CommitDataResult and RevealDataResult functions if the respective query functions CanExecutorCommit and CanExecutorReveal calls succeed. An bug in the call to CanExecutorReveal results in the Msg being approved as gas free when it shouldnt, which allows a malicious user to spam the network with gasless RevealDataResult transactions.
```go
func (d CommitRevealDecorator) checkFreeGas(ctx sdk.Context, coreContract sdk.AccAddress, msg sdk.Msg) bool {
	switch msg := msg.(type) {
	case *wasmtypes.MsgExecuteContract:
                //[..]]

		switch contractMsg := contractMsg.(type) {
                //if CanExecutorCommit succeeds then gas is free
		case CommitDataResult:
			result, err := d.queryContract(ctx, coreContract, CanExecutorCommitQuery{CanExecutorCommit: contractMsg})
			if err != nil {
				return false
			}

			return result

                //if CanExecutorReveal succeeds then gas is free
		case RevealDataResult:
			result, err := d.queryContract(ctx, coreContract, CanExecutorRevealQuery{CanExecutorReveal: contractMsg})
			if err != nil {
				return false
			}
```
### Root Cause

The CanExecutorReveal function only checks if the data request exists, the reveal has started, and the passed public key has an existing commitment to the data request.

These checks are insufficient since they don't check whether or not the user has already revealed. This means that any user can just spam the network with RevealDataResult calls that will be determined as gas free, of which all but the first valid one will revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. DataRequest needs to be submitted and reach the reveal stage


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. DataRequest needs to be submitted and reach the reveal stage
2. A malicious executor, or a malicious user submits a large amount RevealDataResult transactions on behalf of a valid executor who took part in the datarequests reveal stage
3. The malicious submitter is not charged any gas and the network is forced to execute messages for free

### Impact

The blockchain will be spammed with gasless transactions that will slow down and DoS the entire network for free.


### Mitigation

Add a check to CanExecutorReveal which checks if the public key has already revealed or not for the specific data request. The CanExecutorReveal function should prevent the same executor from repeatedly revealing. this will force repeated reveal submissions to be charged gas
