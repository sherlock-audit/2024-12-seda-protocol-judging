# Malicious validator can front-run and steal executor's pending withdrawals

### Summary

Signatures for staking, unstaking, and withdrawals can be used interchangeably allowing a malicious validator to front-run and alter the executor's original intent in their favor potentially stealing funds.

### Root Cause

As can be seen from these code snippets, staking, unstaking, and withdrawal functions expect the format of signatures used:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L13-L14

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L12-L13

This can be exploited by a malicious validator by frontrunning, for example, a legitimate staking request and instead issuing withdrawal action, which will lead to funds withdrawn to the attacker.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Executor sends stake request
2. Malicious validator front-runs reusing a signature but executing withdaw action
3. Funds stolen, original transaction reverts

Note: additionally, a signature can be replayed by an attacker in case a request fails for any reason thus a sequence won't be spent but making the signature publicly known.

### Impact

1. Actions can be front-run and changed (calling unstake instead stake or withdraw)
2. Funds may be stoled in case of withdrawal call

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a parameter to hash, like `action` to make signatures for every action different.
