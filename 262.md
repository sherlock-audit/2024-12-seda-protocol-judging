# Lack of nonces for users allows for Signature replays, allowing accumulation of `votingPower` with the same valid signature for a given batch.

## Summary
In `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch`, there are no nonce being used being used for signers or anything to prevent signature from the same batch posting transaction from being reused this allow signature replays in the same array where the same signature can be reused over and over incrementing the voting power to meet the required threshhold.

### Root Cause
Lack of nonces for signers in that same batch

### Internal Pre-conditions
- No replay Protection

### External Pre-conditions
None

### Attack Path
- A batch which has failed to rich the required voting threshold signature for it to pass 
- A Few valid signature with voting power but were not able to reach the threshold.
- A malicous user can include these validator signature in the `signatures` array past to `postBatch` multiple times ensuring that this repetition will allow the voting threshold to be reached.

[Post Batch function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90C4-L94C52)
```solidity
 function postBatch(
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures, //@audit same signature will be included in this array more than one time
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
```
- Hence the results root being approved where it should not with a passing threshhold.

```solidity
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
            // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
            // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
           //@audit this is a pure function same signature can be verified multiple times, while incrementing voting Power
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
 ==>     votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower; //@audit added multipleTimes for the same signature
        }

```

```solidity
   // @audit Signature will be verified here multiple times as it has been added more than once in the signature array while 
   // incrementing the voting Power.
    function _verifySignature(
        bytes32 messageHash,
        bytes calldata signature,
        address signer
    ) internal pure returns (bool) {
        return ECDSA.recover(messageHash, signature) == signer;
    }
```

### Impact
Invalid batches not reaching the required threshold of validators will be allowed.


### Mitigation
Consider using signature nonces for signers to prevent reuse.
