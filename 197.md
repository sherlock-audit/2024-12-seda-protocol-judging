# A single valid validator can falsify consensus through signature duplication in postBatch

### Summary

A single legitimate validator can call `postBatch` with the same valid signature repeated multiple times until the voting power threshold is reached

### Root Cause

The postBatch function iterates through each validator signature and checks that each validator is a part of the validator set, and correctly signed/attested to the specific batch:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90
```solidity
        uint64 votingPower = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
            // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
            votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
```

Since there is no check if a validators signature has already been checked, a malicious validator can include their own vote multiple times to reach to the consensus votingPower requirements

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The malicious is registered as a validator and has a reasonable amount of voting power
2. A batch completes and the malicious user can submit it

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A validator with significant voting power prepares to submit a malicious batch
2. The single, malicious validator creates a single valid signature and validator proof and duplicates the signature and validator proof multiple times to fill the signatures[] and validatorProofs[] arrays
3. The validator calls postBatch with their doctored and signed data and gains full control over the entire batch consensus process.

### Impact

The systems entire batching consensus mechanism is completely compromised. 

### Mitigation

Implement a uniqueness check on validator addresses during signature verification
