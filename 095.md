# If the key file contains a key whose Index is not within that range, the assignment to `indPubKeys[key.Index]` will cause an “index out of range” panic.

The critical bug lies in the way the key file’s public keys are loaded in the [loadSEDAKeys](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/seda_signer.go#L44-L74) function. The code allocates a slice of length equal to the number of keys:

```go
indPubKeys := make([]pubkeytypes.IndexedPubKey, len(keyFile.Keys))
```

Then, for each key in the file it does:

```go
for _, key := range keyFile.Keys {
	keysMap[key.Index] = key
	indPubKeys[key.Index] = pubkeytypes.IndexedPubKey{
		Index:  uint32(key.Index),
		PubKey: key.PubKey,
	}
}
```

**Issue:**  
This code assumes that each key’s `Index` is a sequential number starting at 0 and less than `len(keyFile.Keys)`. If the key file contains a key whose `Index` is not within that range (for example, if the indices are arbitrary or out of order), the assignment to `indPubKeys[key.Index]` will cause an “index out of range” panic.

**Impact:**  
If an attacker (or an erroneous configuration) can control or supply a key file with such out-of-bound indices, the process handling signing will panic and crash. In the context of a blockchain validator or similar system, this can lead to a disruption in signing transactions or blocks, potentially causing downtime, loss of funds (e.g., via missed rewards or slashing penalties), and unauthorized disruption of service.

## Mitigation
To fix this, the code should not assume that `key.Index` falls within the allocated slice length. Instead, it should either:
- Append to the slice (using `append`), or
- Allocate the slice based on the maximum key index found (with appropriate bounds checking), or
- Validate that each `key.Index` is within the expected range before assignment.
