# User may not get paid out rightful fees if they used account abstraction to interact with the protocol.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L174

The `_transferFee` function used throughout the `SedaCoreV1.sol` file is used with a `msg.sender` call. This is used to transfer fees back to the sender of the transaction.

### Root Cause

Use of msg.sender instead of chosen address in SedaCoreV1.sol

### Internal Pre-conditions

User is using account abstraction contract with no ability to receive eth or chains native token on it.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User using account abstraction is to be paid out fees using the _transferFee() function. (e.g. in postResult)

### Impact

However if a user called the function using an account abstraction setup they may not have the ability to receive eth (or other native chain token) to that contract. This would lead to the transferFee function always reverting, and the user not being able to retrieve their funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A solution would be to allow the requestor to set a payable address to receive these fees on in the event of fee payout. If not supplied, the function can default to `msg.sender`. This would allow users the customisability to utilise account abstraction contracts where receiving is blocked, while having no risk of losing fees while using the protocol.
