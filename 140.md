# Insufficient EndTime Validation Allows Immediate Vesting Unlock

### Summary

Because `EndTime` is not strictly validated to be greater than the current block time, a new VestingAccount can be created such that the vesting period appears already expired. This effectively bypasses the intended lockup mechanism if the creator sets the `EndTime` to a value in the past.

### Root Cause

Within `MsgCreateVestingAccount.ValidateBasic()`, the code only checks whether `EndTime` is greater than zero, without enforcing that `EndTime` must be strictly greater than the current block timestamp. As a result, a VestingAccount can be created with an `EndTime` earlier than the current time, which causes the funds to be immediately unlocked.

```go
func (m *MsgCreateVestingAccount) ValidateBasic() error {
	if err := validateAmount(m.Amount); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	if m.EndTime <= 0 { // <---------
		return sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrap("invalid end time")
	}
	return nil
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A **user** crafts a `MsgCreateVestingAccount` with `msg.EndTime` set to a timestamp earlier than the current block time (for example, `EndTime=1`).
2. The **user** submits this transaction to the chain.
3. The chain accepts and creates a VestingAccount that is effectively “expired” upon creation, leaving all tokens immediately unlocked.
4. The **user** (or holder of that address) gains complete control over the funds, circumventing the lockup period.

### Impact

Any module or participant that relies on a valid lockup period—such as protocols, project teams, and investors—may be affected. Tokens intended to be locked become fully available at creation, breaking the expected vesting model and potentially undermining economic and security assumptions.

### PoC

None.

### Mitigation

Add a strict validation check in `ValidateBasic()` (or in associated business logic) to ensure:

```go
if msg.EndTime <= ctx.BlockTime().Unix() {
    return sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrap("end time must be greater than the current block time")
}
```

By requiring `EndTime` to exceed the current block’s timestamp, newly created vesting accounts can no longer be improperly unlocked on creation.
