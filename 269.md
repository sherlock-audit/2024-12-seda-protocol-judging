# No Filter will lead to outliers still getting rewarded

### Summary

When applying [no filter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/filters.go#L36-L38), it will always return a slice of all false outliers. This causes rewards to be distributed to all Executors, including the outliers.

### Root Cause

In [`filters.go:36-38`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/filters.go#L36-L38), the `ApplyFilter()` for `FilterNone` always returns a slice of all false outliers.

```golang
func (f FilterNone) ApplyFilter(reveals []RevealBody, _ []bool) ([]bool, bool) {
        // @audit the first return value is a slice of false values
	return make([]bool, len(reveals)), true
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A "tallying" data request is processed by the Tally module's `EndBlock()` and it [applies](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L77) the filter. 
2. [No filter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/filters.go#L36-L38) is applied and all reveals are declared as non-outliers even if there may be one or more outliers.
3. When gas for executors is metered, outliers should be [skipped](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L139-L141). However, since all reveals are set as non-outliers, every Executor will be rewarded gas.

### Impact

Outliers will still be rewarded at the expense of executors who submitted accurate data.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider modifying `NoFilter`'s `ApplyFilter()` to return an accurate set of outliers rather than setting all reveals as non-outliers.
