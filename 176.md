# Frontrunning postBatch results in the actor becoming batch.sender and stealing the batchFee

### Summary

The lack of access control in `Secp256k1ProverV1.postBatch` allows any user to frontrun a legitimate call, becoming the `batch.sender`. Later, when `SedaCoreV1.postResult` is called, the frontrunner receives `requestDetails.batchFee`, leading to a loss for the legitimate batch sender.

### Root Cause

The function `postBatch` does not restrict who can call it, allowing any actor to submit a batch and become the sender.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

1. A legitimate user must intend to call `postBatch` and pay for gas.

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate user prepares a transaction to call `postBatch` with valid batch data.
2. A frontrunner detects the transaction in the mempool.
3. The frontrunner copies the batch data and submits `postBatch` with the same parameters but a higher gas fee.
5. Later, when `postResult` is executed, `batchFee` is transferred to the frontrunner instead of the legitimate sender.


### Impact

The legitimate batch submitter loses the `batchFee`, which is instead stolen by the frontrunner.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict `postBatch` to only allow authorized entities to submit batches. Potential fixes include:
1. Implementing a signature-based authentication mechanism.
2. Allowing only specific pre-approved addresses to submit batches.
