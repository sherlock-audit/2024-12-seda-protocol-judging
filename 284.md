# The outlier gets the reduced payout when there is consensus on errors

### Summary

The payout for Executors is [reduced](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L239-L240) when there is no consensus on the filter results. However, when 2/3 of the reveals are errors, it is not treated as consensus because of an error in the consensus check. 

### Root Cause

In [`filter.go:79`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L79), the [consensus check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L79) for errors is incorrectly implemented. The errors must be greater than 2/3 of the reveals for a consensus with errors, which should not be the case.

```golang
// @audit the check must be `countErrors(res.errors)*3 >= len(reveals)*2`
case countErrors(res.Errors)*3 > len(reveals)*2:
```

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The Tally Module is processing a data request and executing its filter. It has 2/3 of the reveals as errors and has a `FilterMode` filter.
2. When the FilterMode [filter](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L77) is applied, it returns a slice of outliers with the errors set as outliers and false on consensus.
3. Since there is consensus on errors, this [branch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L79-L81) should be executed, and consensus should be set to true. Instead, the [no-consensus branch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/filter.go#L82-L84) runs.
4. When the metering for executors is processed, the [reduced payout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L239-L241) is applied because of the `ErrConsensusInError` error.

### Impact

The outlier who reported no error will receive a reduced payout. The intended behavior is for the non-outliers who reported the errors to receive the full payout.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider changing the check to `case countErrors(res.Errors)*3 >= len(reveals)*2:`
