# The protocols fee distribution mechanism rewards the first solver msgsender who calls postResult with the entire resultFee and a portion of the requestFee can lead to frontrunning

## **Potential Front-Running in Fee Distribution**

**Impact:**  
The protocol’s fee distribution mechanism rewards the first solver (`msg.sender`) who calls `postResult` with the entire `resultFee` and a portion of the `requestFee` ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:122-202](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122-L202)) ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:GAS-LIMIT](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162)). This creates a scenario susceptible to **front-running**: a malicious actor could monitor for valid result data and attempt to submit the result transaction before the intended solver. By doing so, the attacker would claim the solver’s rewards (both the `resultFee` and any eligible `requestFee` share), undermining the fairness of the system. In a public mempool, if the result data or proof can be predicted or copied, an attacker can use higher gas price or miner bribery to get their transaction mined first. The legitimate solver then either loses the reward or has their transaction revert because the result was already posted.

Additionally, if a batch fee is offered (for aggregators combining requests), an attacker might try to intercept that as well. For instance, if no batch sender is initially present (meaning the batch fee would be refunded to the requestor), a malicious actor could try to **become the batch sender** by somehow batching the request last-minute, thus capturing the `batchFee` that would otherwise return to the requestor ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:BATCH_FEE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L181-L189)). Overall, the design currently relies on first-come-first-serve result submission, which can be unfairly gamed.

**POC:**  
While this issue is about transaction ordering rather than a code bug, we can illustrate the front-running scenario with pseudo-code and comments:

```solidity
// Assume two solvers, A and B, both have computed the correct result for a given request.
bytes32 reqId = /* the target request ID */;

// Solver A prepares to submit the result
// (this includes the correct payload and proof for reqId)
tx1 = seda.postResult(resultForReqId, batchHeight, proof);  // from solver A

// Malicious solver B sees A's transaction in the mempool (or anticipates the result).
// B crafts an identical result submission, aiming to beat A.
tx2 = seda.postResult(resultForReqId, batchHeight, proof);  // from solver B (front-run)

// B sets a higher gas price on tx2 to get it mined before tx1.
```

In this scenario, Solver B’s transaction **front-runs** Solver A’s. As a result, B becomes the `msg.sender` in `postResult` and receives the entire `resultFee` (and any proportional `requestFee` share). Solver A’s transaction will then fail (because the request is no longer pending). The rightful solver is deprived of the reward, which goes to the attacker who simply copied the result. This exploit requires that B can obtain the result data—if results or proofs are not confidential, the risk is significant.

**Mitigation:**  
To mitigate front-running of result submissions, the protocol should introduce a mechanism that makes it infeasible to steal someone’s result by simply racing them. Common approaches include:
- **Commit-Reveal Scheme:** Solvers first submit a hash of the result (commit) and later reveal the actual result. This way, an attacker cannot immediately know the result data to front-run. For example:  

  ```solidity
  mapping(bytes32 => bytes32) public resultCommits;
  function commitResult(bytes32 requestId, bytes32 resultHash) external {
      require(resultCommits[requestId] == bytes32(0), "Already committed");
      resultCommits[requestId] = resultHash;
      // (Optionally, require a small stake to discourage spam)
  }
  function revealResult(bytes32 requestId, bytes calldata actualResult, ...otherParams) external {
      require(keccak256(actualResult) == resultCommits[requestId], "Hash mismatch");
      // Proceed with verification and reward distribution
      delete resultCommits[requestId];
      // Reward solver with fees if result is valid
  }
  ```  

  In this commit-reveal design, an attacker cannot front-run the commit phase because they don’t have the actual result. By the time of reveal, it’s too late to front-run since the solver’s commitment is already locked in.

- **Encrypted or Private Submission:** If feasible, allow results to be submitted in an encrypted form to be decrypted by the contract or a trusted mediator, reducing visibility in the mempool. (This is more complex and often involves specialized infrastructure or zero-knowledge proofs.)

- **Solver Staking & Slashing:** Introduce an economic cost to illegitimately grabbing tasks. For example, solvers register and put up a stake; if they attempt to front-run or submit incorrect results, they lose stake, discouraging malicious behavior.

Implementing a commit-reveal is the most straightforward Solidity-level mitigation. The pseudo-code above demonstrates the approach. By requiring a commit first, the protocol ensures that a solver’s intention to answer is recorded, and only that solver can later reveal the correct answer. This significantly raises the difficulty for an attacker to successfully front-run and claim fees for work they didn’t do.
