# immediate panic during denom registration can crash the node

In the function [RegisterDenoms](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/params/config.go#L43-L53), the code registers two denominations by calling:
  
```go
err := sdk.RegisterDenom(BaseCoinUnit, math.LegacyNewDecWithPrec(1, SedaExponent))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
  
and then for the human-readable denomination. This pattern of “register-and-panic” has the following drawbacks:
- If—for any reason—another module (or even an upgrade to the chain) tries to register the same denomination (say, with a slightly different conversion factor) or if the registration is attempted more than once, the registration function will return an error. The immediate `panic(err)` will then cause the entire node (or chain) to crash.

- In a live blockchain network, such a panic during initialization (or during an upgrade where modules might be reloaded) would halt the node. In a multi-node setting, if a significant number of nodes crash, this could lead to a network-wide disruption. Although funds are not “stolen” per se, halted state transitions mean that transfers, staking operations, or any state changes will not be processed—which can effectively lock up users’ funds until the issue is resolved.


## Root Cause:
The root cause is that the denomination registration code uses an immediate panic for error handling rather than checking for and safely managing duplicate or conflicting registrations, leading to an uncontrolled shutdown when an error occurs.

## Impact:
The primary impact is that any error during denomination registration triggers an immediate panic that crashes the node, halting all operations such as fund transfers and state changes, which could effectively lock user funds.

## Mitigation:
 Adopt idempotent and graceful error handling to safely manage duplicate registrations and avoid such critical disruptions.
