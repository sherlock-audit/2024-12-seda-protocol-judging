# Missing Access Control in SedaCoreV1.increaseFees() would lead to unauthorized fee increase

### Summary

The missing Access control modifier in [`increaseFees()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206-L227) in the `SedaCoreV1.sol` contract would lead to allowing anyone or user being able to call the `increaseFees()` function to increase fees. 

But the comment before the function clearly states that it allows the owner increase fees 

```solidity
       /// @inheritdoc ISedaCore
    /// @dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request    @>>>Audit 
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {       // @>>>audit
```

Inasmuch as the whenNotPaused modifer was implemented, the verification to ensure the caller of the function is the owner is missing, and this isn't the intended behaviour of the function and the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `SedaCoreV1.sol:211` there is a missing check on the `increaseFee` function, hereby the function isn't restricted to the owner calling it as the comment before the function clearly stated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Nil

### External Pre-conditions

Nil

### Attack Path

1. An attacker identifies a pending request by its request ID that exists in the contract’s storage.
2. Since there’s no `onlyOwner` (or equivalent) modifier, the attacker can call the `increaseFees` function directly. They can supply arbitrary values for `additionalRequestFee`, `additionalResultFee`, and `additionalBatchFee`—for example, extremely high amounts—provided they send the corresponding ETH (i.e., `msg.value` equals the sum of these fees).


### Impact

Nil

### PoC

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc ISedaCore
    /// @dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {     // @>>> missing access control
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }


        RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
        if (details.timestamp == 0) {
            revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        }


        details.requestFee += additionalRequestFee;
        details.resultFee += additionalResultFee;
        details.batchFee += additionalBatchFee;


        emit FeesIncreased(requestId, additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee);
    }
```

In as-much as it overrides the `SedaCore Interface`, there's still no implementation of the access control on the [`increaseFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/interfaces/ISedaCore.sol#L89-L94) function on the interface. 
```solidity
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable;
```

### Mitigation

Restrict who can call increaseFees in accordance to what the comment's doc states.
