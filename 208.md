# Attacker can exploits batch sender role to block result Submissions via fee transfer reversion

### Summary
The `postBatch` function can be called by any address if all parameters are valid—that is, if the batch includes valid signatures from validators present in `s.lastValidatorsRoot` and the batch itself is valid. The address that submits the batch becomes its sender and is entitled to receive the `batchFee` rewards from all results corresponding to that batch. However, if the batch sender is a contract that reverts when receiving native tokens, then the results for that batch cannot be posted.

### Root Cause
The `postBatch` function allows any address to submit a batch as long as the following conditions are met:

**1. Batch Height is Greater Than the Previous One**
```solidity
            if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
                revert InvalidBatchHeight();
            }
```
which is true for upcoming batch

**2. Validators in the validatorProofs Are Part of the Latest lastValidatorsRoot**
```solidity
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
```
This validation confirms that each validator who signed the batch is included in the most recent validators root.

**3- signatures for `batchId` are valid and belong to the validators:**
```solidity
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
```

**4- voting power percentage exceeds the `CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE`:**
```solidity
        if (votingPower < CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE) {
            revert ConsensusNotReached();
        }
```
This check ensures that the cumulative voting power of the validators who signed the batch exceeds the consensus threshold (typically 66.6%).

Once these validations pass, the state is updated to assign the batch sender to msg.sender:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L131
```solidity
s.batches[newBatch.batchHeight] = BatchData({resultsRoot: newBatch.resultsRoot, sender: msg.sender});
```

When `postResult` is later called, after verifying that the result ID is included in the batch’s `resultsRoot`, the `batchFee` is sent to the `batchSender`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L181-L190
```solidity
        if (requestDetails.batchFee > 0) {
            if (batchSender == address(0)) {
                // If no batch sender, send all batch fee to requestor
                refundAmount += requestDetails.batchFee;
            } else {
                // Send batch fee to batch sender
                //@audit batchSender does not accept ether
                _transferFee(batchSender, requestDetails.batchFee);
                emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, batchSender, requestDetails.batchFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.BATCH);
            }
        }
```
If the batchSender is a contract that does not accept native tokens, the fee transfer (and `postResult`) will fail:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L356-L360
```solidity
    function _transferFee(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        // Using low-level call instead of transfer()
        (bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed();
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
- The contract must not be in a paused state.
- Batch.resultsRoot must not be bytes32(0), meaning it must contain valid results.

### External Pre-conditions
- The `postBatch` transaction is processed through a public mempool.
- The sender of `postBatch` is a contract that does not accept ether in its receive function.

### Attack Path
- A very popular DeFi platform relies on the SEDA chain to fetch critical, time-sensitive data and submits 10 requests to the SedaCoreV1 contract.
- A solver submits a `postBatch` transaction containing a `resultsRoot` that covers the results for these 10 requests, along with results for other requests.
- An attacker deploys a contract that reverts when it receives native tokens.
- The attacker front-runs the solver's transaction by offering a much higher gas fee.
- The attacker's transaction is processed, causing the malicious contract to become the batch sender.
- When `postResult` is called, it reverts because the batch sender contract does not accept native ens

### Impact
- Results for the batch cannot be posted.
- The attack is almost cost-free for the attacker (aside from a negligible gas fee on L2s). An attacker can repeatedly become the batch sender for all batches and block all `postResult` requests.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Ensure that batch sender is a valid solver:
```solidity
    function postBatch(
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures,
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
      if(!validSubmitter[msg.sender]) revert InvalidBatchSender();
```
