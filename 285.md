# Users can front-run the solver's transaction and withdraw the fees for the timed out data request

### Summary

Currently, the data requests are filtered and tallied in the end blocker. But before that, there is a call to the CosmWasm contract to expire timed out data requests for the current height and move the status to `Tallying` which will be processed afterwards.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact the timed out requests can still be processed and posted on the destination chain but the users can front-run the call and withdraw all the fees from the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

Attackers can call the `withdrawTimedOutRequest()` after the batch has been posted and post the result using the fees of other entities who posted a data request.

### Attack Path

Attackers can call the `withdrawTimedOutRequest()` after the batch has been posted and post the result using the fees of other entities who posted a data request.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the solver.

### PoC

The timed out requests can be processed in the endblocker as it first expires all the requests for the current height and moves it to the `Tallying` status:

```go
	postRes, err := k.wasmKeeper.Sudo(ctx, coreContract, []byte(`{"expire_data_requests":{}}`))
	if err != nil {
		k.Logger(ctx).Error("[HALTS_DR_FLOW] failed to expire data requests", "err", err)
		return nil
	}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/state/data_requests_map.rs#L209-223
```go
   pub fn expire_data_requests(&self, store: &mut dyn Storage, current_height: u64) -> StdResult<Vec<String>> {
        // remove them from the timeouts and return the hashes
        let drs_to_update_to_tally = self.timeouts.remove_by_timeout_height(store, current_height)?;

        drs_to_update_to_tally
            .into_iter()
            .map(|hash| {
                // get the dr itself
                let dr = self.get(store, &hash)?;
                // update it to tallying
                self.update(store, hash, dr, Some(DataRequestStatus::Tallying), current_height, true)?;
                Ok(hash.to_hex())
            })
            .collect::<StdResult<Vec<_>>>()
    }
```

This is a problem as the requests are basically timed out so the fees can be withdrawn on the destination chain:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L231-256
```solidity

   function withdrawTimedOutRequest(bytes32 requestId) external {
        RequestDetails memory details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];

        // Verify request exists
        if (details.timestamp == 0) {
            revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        }

        // Check if request has timed out using current timeout period
        if (block.timestamp < details.timestamp + _storageV1().timeoutPeriod) {
            revert RequestNotTimedOut(requestId, block.timestamp, details.timestamp + _storageV1().timeoutPeriod);
        }

        // Calculate total refund
        uint256 totalRefund = details.requestFee + details.resultFee + details.batchFee;

        // Clean up state before transfer to prevent reentrancy
        _removePendingRequest(requestId);
        delete _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];

        // Transfer total fees to data request creator
        if (totalRefund > 0) {
            _transferFee(details.requestor, totalRefund);
            emit FeeDistributed(requestId, details.requestor, totalRefund, FeeType.WITHDRAW);
        }
    }


```


It opens up an opportunity to front-run the solver's call and just withdraw the fees and then post a result using other funds that lie in the contract (potentially front-running as well)

### Mitigation

Consider changing the current functionality restricting the possibility to withdraw the funds in a way described in this report.
