# proxyReward parameter is incorrecly calculated

### Summary

The proxy gas is determined by multiplying the individual gas used per execution on the replication factor which is not correct as it forms the total amount for all proxies.

### Root Cause

Calculations for a single proxy is done improperly as the amount multiplied by the replication factor additionally.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

Mistake in the calculations of the proxy rewards.

### Impact

An individual proxy will be overpaid but other proxies will be underpaid.

### PoC

Let's take a look at the implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L101-121
```go

// ConsumeExecGasForProxy consumes execution gas for data proxy payout and records
// the payout information. It returns true if the execution gas runs out during
// the process.
func (g *GasMeter) ConsumeExecGasForProxy(proxyPubkey, payoutAddr string, gasUsedPerExec uint64, replicationFactor uint16) bool {
	amount := gasUsedPerExec * uint64(replicationFactor)

	g.Proxies = append(g.Proxies, ProxyGasUsed{
		PayoutAddress: payoutAddr,
		PublicKey:     proxyPubkey,
		Amount:        math.NewIntFromUint64(amount),
	})

	if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}

	g.totalProxyGasPerExec += gasUsedPerExec
	g.execGasRemaining -= amount
	return false
}

```

The problem here is that the amount is determined by multiplying the `gasUsedPerExec` and the `replicationFactor`. This is incorrect as the `gasUsedPerExec` is the amount that's needed to be paid according to the whitepaper formula:


```go

proxyGasUsed = proxyFee / gasPrice

```

In the previous step, it's exactly calculated like that:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L87-95
```go

	gasUsedPerExecInt := proxyConfig.Fee.Amount.Quo(gasMeter.GasPrice())
		var gasUsedPerExec uint64
		if gasUsedPerExecInt.IsUint64() {
			gasUsedPerExec = min(gasUsedPerExecInt.Uint64(), gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
		} else {
			gasUsedPerExec = min(stdmath.MaxUint64, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
		}

		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForProxy(pubKey, proxyConfig.PayoutAddress, gasUsedPerExec, replicationFactor)

```

Therefore, multiplying it by `replicationFactor` is totally incorrect as it will reflect the total amount that's need to be paid to the proxies.

### Mitigation

Change the amount calculations and don't multiply amount by the `replicationFactor` for a single proxy reward calculation.
