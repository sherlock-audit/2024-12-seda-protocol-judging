# Replication factor will be not properly checked as the number of stakers is reflected inaccurately

### Summary

At this moment, the stakers who made an unstaking transaction but didn't yet withdraw will still be accounted when calculating the stakers length and checking it against the replication factor giving the false representation of the value as they have no means to commit/reveal results.

### Root Cause

Stakers who have withdrawn the stake are accounted in the active stakers calculation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

Stakers length is miscalculated.

### Impact

Replication factor will be incorrectly checked as the number of stakers can be significantly lower and the check will pass anyway.

### PoC

There is the following check when posting a request to the SEDA chain:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L17-19
```rust

     if self.posted_dr.replication_factor as u32 > stakers_length {
            return Err(ContractError::DataRequestReplicationFactorTooHigh(stakers_length));
        }

```

Here, the `replication_factor` is checked against the `stakers_length` but the problem is that the stakers can be already not active (requested a withdrawal) and therefore can't commit/reveal but still accounted:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L27-33
```rust
     // update the executor (remove if balances are zero)
        executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal -= self.amount;
        if executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal.is_zero() && executor.tokens_staked.is_zero() {
            state::STAKERS.remove(deps.storage, public_key)?;
        } else {
            state::STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
        }

```

As you can see here, the staker is removed only when the stake is completely withdrawn but if it's not withdrawn even if `total_staked` is 0, a staker is still accounted in the stakers length. Moreover, the executors who are not eligible to commit/reveal as they don't meet `minimum_stake_for_committee_eligibility` criteria shouldn't be accounted as well.

### Mitigation

Consider changing the way the stakers are accounted in the system so that the replication factor check will become correct.
