# Mean-Based Outlier Detection Vulnerability Allows Single Node to Sabotage Consensus

### Summary

Using the arithmetic mean instead of median in the standard deviation filter can cause a consensus failure for the entire protocol as a malicious nodes can manipulate the mean/ standard deviation calculation by submitting appropriate values.  And if that is not possible based on distribution of values,  it can also strategically alter which values are considered part of the consensus set, thereby manipulating the final output value even if later median is used for the final calculation.

### Root Cause

The choice to use arithmetic mean in the `FilterStdDev.ApplyFilter` at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/filters.go#L225  implementation is problematic as it makes the outlier detection mechanism vulnerable to extreme value manipulation. In `detectOutliersBigInt()`, the code calculates the mean of all values (`mean := sum.Div(sum, n)`) rather than the median, making the system susceptible to skewing by a single extreme value.

Notably, there is a **comment** in the code that suggests median should have been used:

```go
// ApplyFilter applies the Standard Deviation Filter and returns an
// outlier list. A reveal is declared an outlier if it deviates from
// the median by more than the sample standard deviation multiplied
// by the given sigma multiplier value.
```

This comment explicitly states that values should be compared against the **median**, but the implementation actually compares them against the **mean**, creating potential for this vulnerability.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. **Honest nodes submit values** within a reasonable range 
2. **Malicious node submits an extreme value** close to the maximum allowed by the data type (e.g., close to maxUint64)
3. **Mean calculation is severely skewed** toward the extreme value
4. **Standard deviation calculation is affected** 
5. **Some honest values are marked as outliers** since they deviate significantly from the skewed mean
6. **Consensus check fails** as less than 2/3 of nodes are considered non-outliers OR the new mean/median output is incorrect

### Impact

The protocol suffers consensus failure, preventing it from finalizing the current round of data aggregation. The attacker gains the ability to block consensus without requiring control of 1/3 of the network, circumventing the protocol's fault tolerance guarantees.
More importantly, even when consensus doesn't completely fail, the attacker can strategically manipulate which values are included in the final consensus set. This allows them to shift the final output value (regardless of whether mean or median is used for the final calculation) by selectively excluding honest node contributions that don't align with their desired outcome.

### PoC

The vulnerability can be demonstrated using Chebyshev's inequality, which states:
P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k²
Where:

X is a random variable with mean μ and standard deviation σ
k is a positive real number

According to Chebyshev's inequality, up to 1/k² values can be outside k standard deviations from the mean. This means if sigma multiplier (k) is set to 1.5, up to 44% of values can be legitimately outside this range.
A malicious node or group of malicious nodes can exploit this in two critical ways:
a) They can strategically submit values that push upto 44% of values outside the acceptable range, causing consensus failure since consensus requires 2/3 (or approximately 67%) of nodes to agree. By pushing upto 44% of values outside the range, they ensure that less than the required threshold remains, effectively blocking consensus.
b) Alternatively if above is not possible due to distribution, they can selectively target specific honest values to push out of the consensus set while allowing others to remain. This strategic exclusion lets them manipulate the final output value, whether it's calculated as a mean or median, since they've already controlled which values are included in that calculation.
