# First-time validators can escape double-signing slashing penalties

### Summary

Malicious users who become validators and double-sign on their first batch as a validator can escape slashing penalties

### Root Cause

In `evidence.go` the double-sign evidence verification attempts to retrieve the validator's ethereum address from their previous batch signature:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L27
```go
validatorEthAddr, err := k.getEthAddressForBatch(ctx, evidence.BatchNumber-1, evidence.OperatorAddress)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

if !bytes.Equal(validatorEthAddr, signatureAddr) {
    return fmt.Errorf("recovered address does not match validator entry. Recorded: %s, Got: %s", hex.EncodeToString(validatorEthAddr), hex.EncodeToString(signatureAddr))
}
```

If this is the first batch they are signing, then there won't be a previous entry by this validator, this check will fail, and the double-signing evidence will be rejected even when valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A validator is participating in batch signing for the first time (has never signed a batch before)
2. The slashing mechanism relies on comparing the address recovered from a fraudulent signature with the address recorded in a validator's previous batch entry
3. No special handling exists for validators signing their first batch

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A new validator (or existing validator who has never signed a batch) prepares to sign their first batch (batch number n)
2. Validator deliberately creates and signs two (or more) different versions of batch n using the same key
3. Both conflicting versions of batch n are propagated to the network
4. Evidence of double-signing is submitted to the chain
5. The evidence handling mechanism attempts to retrieve the validator's Ethereum address from batch n-1
6. Since the validator has no previous batch (n-1), the getEthAddressForBatch function returns an error
7. The error causes the evidence handling to fail, and the double-signing evidence is rejected
8. The validator successfully evades the slashing penalty despite having committed a clear double-signing violation

### Impact

The security model of the blockchain is severely compromised. Validators could continuously exploit this vulnerability by registering new validator entities to double sign their first batches with impunity. This creates attack vectors for blockchain forks and consensus failures without economic consequences for the attackers. The integrity of batched data could be compromised, leading to inconsistent states and potential financial losses for users relying on batch data finality.

### Mitigation

Maintain a record of all validator public keys that they have registered and check if there was a double sign involving any of these signatures
