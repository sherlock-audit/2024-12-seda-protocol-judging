# A malicious actor will cause node misconfiguration through unverified network configuration downloads

### Summary

The lack of cryptographic verification of downloaded network configuration files could lead to node misconfiguration as a malicious actor could serve invalid network parameters during initial setup.

### Root Cause

n `seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/init.go`-[seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/init.go](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/init.go#L72 the `downloadAndApplyNetworkConfig` function lacks cryptographic verification of downloaded configuration integrity:
```go
err = DownloadGitFiles(network, configDir)
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Node operator must be performing initial setup
2. Target directory must not have existing configuration files

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker must be able to intercept network traffic during initial setup
2. The attack must occur during the specific window of node initialization

### Attack Path

1. Node operator initiates setup with `sedad join moniker --network devnet`
2. Attacker intercepts the network configuration download request
3. Attacker serves modified but valid-looking configuration files
4. Node applies the configuration without verifying authenticity

### Impact

The node operator experiences incorrect network configuration. The attacker cannot execute arbitrary code but can cause:
- Node connecting to wrong network peers
- Incorrect genesis parameters
- Failed network synchronization
The impact is limited as:
- Invalid configurations would fail to sync with the network
- Node operator would detect issues during startup
- No private key compromise is possible

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add hash verification of downloaded configurations:
```go
func downloadAndApplyNetworkConfig(network, moniker string, config *cfg.Config) (chainID, seeds string, err error) {
    // Download files with their known good hashes
    files, hashes, err := DownloadGitFilesWithHashes(network, configDir)
    if err != nil {
        return "", "", err
    }
    
    // Verify against known good hashes from trusted source
    if err := verifyConfigHashes(files, hashes); err != nil {
        return "", "", fmt.Errorf("configuration verification failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Continue with existing logic...
}
```
