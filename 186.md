# Seda chain halt from vote poisoning

## Summary
Seda chain relies heavily on ABCI's VerifyVoteExtensionHandler being executed for every vote extension from every validator. Unfortunately, CometBFT doesn't call this function for vote extensions received after the quorum is reached. As a result, duplicate votes received post-quorum are added to the commit info and find their way into the next proposed block. ProcessProposal function of all validators then rejects the proposal, and the vicious cycle repeats with the next proposal: Omni chain is permanently halted, and no new blocks are produced.

```solidity
func (h *Handlers) VerifyVoteExtensionHandler() sdk.VerifyVoteExtensionHandler {
	return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abcitypes.RequestVerifyVoteExtension) (*abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension, error) {
		h.logger.Debug("start verify vote extension handler", "request", req)

		batch, err := h.batchingKeeper.GetBatchForHeight(ctx, ctx.BlockHeight()+BlockOffsetSignPhase)
		if err != nil {
			if errors.Is(err, collections.ErrNotFound) {
				if req.VoteExtension == nil {
					return &abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension{Status: abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension_ACCEPT}, nil
				}
				h.logger.Error(
					"received vote extension even though we're skipping batching",
					"request", req.ValidatorAddress,
					"height", req.Height,
					"vote_extension", req.VoteExtension,
				)
				return &abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension{Status: abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension_REJECT}, nil
			}
			return nil, err
		}

		err = h.verifyBatchSignatures(ctx, batch.BatchNumber, batch.BatchId, req.VoteExtension, req.ValidatorAddress)
		if err != nil {
			h.logger.Error("failed to verify batch signature", "req", req, "err", err)
			return nil, err
		}

		h.logger.Debug(
			"successfully verified signature",
			"request", req.ValidatorAddress,
			"height", req.Height,
			"batch_number", batch.BatchNumber,
		)
		return &abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension{Status: abcitypes.ResponseVerifyVoteExtension_ACCEPT}, nil
	}
}
```
But, as explained above, this check is bypassed by votes received after the quorum is reached. Duplicate votes received post-quorum are added to the commit info, poisoning it.

To create the next block, CometBFT then proceeds to call proposing validator's PrepareProposal This function calls baseapp.ValidateVoteExtensions, which does not verify the presence of duplicates.
All non-proposing validators then receive the proposed block, and CometBFT calls ProcessProposal. The call then proceeds to verifyAggVotes which calls AggVote::Verify for each aggregate vote; and this function checks for duplicates. As a result, duplicate votes are detected, and the proposal is rejected by all validators.

As no new block is created, the next proposing validator employs the same poisoned votes with duplicates from the commit info of the previous block, forms an invalid proposal, which is then rejected by all validators; the vicious loop proceeds ad infinitum. Sedachain is halted.
## Impact
Leads to halted chain
## Recommended Mitigation
As explained in the cited above [CometBFT documentation for PrepareProposal method](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/spec/abci/abci++_methods#prepareproposal), we recommend to modify PrepareProposal, and verify all votes from commit info in the same way they are verified in VerifyVoteExtension. It should be implemented in a way though which is resilient against errors in order not to halt the chain. E.g. when a duplicate vote is detected, the function should not error out, but instead detect/report/ignore the duplication, and proceed with constructing the proposal.
