# The Data Result's `exitCode` is defined as `uint8` in EVM contracts, but it should be `uint32`

### Summary

Under seda-chain contracts, the exitCode is defined as `uint32` in the DataResult struct: 

```go
// DataResult represents the result of a resolved data request.
type DataResult struct {
	// id is the Keccack-256 hash of the data result.
	Id string `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=id,proto3" json:"id"`
	// dr_id is the data request identifier.
	DrId string `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=dr_id,json=drId,proto3" json:"dr_id"`
	// dr_block_height is the height at which the data request was submitted.
	DrBlockHeight uint64 `protobuf:"varint,3,opt,name=dr_block_height,json=drBlockHeight,proto3" json:"dr_block_height"`
	// version is a semantic version string.
	Version string `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=version,proto3" json:"version"`
	// block_height is the height at which the data request was tallied.
	BlockHeight uint64 `protobuf:"varint,5,opt,name=block_height,json=blockHeight,proto3" json:"block_height"`
	// block_timestamp is the unix timestamp in seconds of when the data request
	// was tallied.
	BlockTimestamp uint64 `protobuf:"varint,6,opt,name=block_timestamp,json=blockTimestamp,proto3" json:"block_timestamp"`
	// exit_code is the exit code of the tally wasm binary execution.
>@	ExitCode uint32 `protobuf:"varint,7,opt,name=exit_code,json=exitCode,proto3" json:"exit_code"`
	// gas_used is the gas used by the data request execution.
	GasUsed *cosmossdk_io_math.Int `protobuf:"bytes,8,opt,name=gas_used,json=gasUsed,proto3,customtype=cosmossdk.io/math.Int" json:"gas_used"`
	// result is the result of the tally wasm binary execution.
	Result []byte `protobuf:"bytes,9,opt,name=result,proto3" json:"result"`
	// payback_address is the payback address set by the relayer.
	PaybackAddress string `protobuf:"bytes,10,opt,name=payback_address,json=paybackAddress,proto3" json:"payback_address"`
	// seda_payload is the payload set by SEDA Protocol (e.g. OEV-enabled
	// data requests)
	SedaPayload string `protobuf:"bytes,11,opt,name=seda_payload,json=sedaPayload,proto3" json:"seda_payload"`
	// consensus indicates whether consensus was reached in the tally
	// process.
	Consensus bool `protobuf:"varint,12,opt,name=consensus,proto3" json:"consensus"`
}
```

But, meanwhile on EVM contracts:

```solidity
struct Result {
        /// Semantic Version
        string version;
        /// Data Request Identifier
        bytes32 drId;
        /// True or false whether the reveal results are in consensus or not (â‰¥ 66%)
        bool consensus;
        /// Exit code of Tally WASM binary execution
>@    uint8 exitCode;
        /// Result from Tally WASM binary execution
        bytes result;
        /// Block Height at which data request was finalized
        uint64 blockHeight;
        /// The timestamp of the block the data result is included
        uint64 blockTimestamp;
        /// Gas used by the complete data request execution
        uint128 gasUsed;
        // Fields from Data Request Execution
        /// Payback address set by the relayer
        bytes paybackAddress;
        /// Payload set by SEDA Protocol (e.g. OEV-enabled data requests)
        bytes sedaPayload;
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [batching.pb.go](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/types/batching.pb.go#L311C19-L311C94) file, the exitcode is a `uint32` value defined. This is a member of DataResult struct that is the result of the data request that was made via the Oracle program on SEDA network. This struct will be posted via linking it to the orginal data request, so that the result is available to the requestor.

But on EVM chains, this might cause an issue, as this same struct member is declared as `uint8` [exitCode on EVM](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L60-L83)

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

Due to difference in data type in the backend that is used to process the requests and if the request tally is computed and the response is to be sent on EVM, to originating oracle that made the request, this will cause discrepancy.

### Impact

When a request fails due to any exit code (>64) that is generated and logged in seda-chain contracts, and is being posted by solver on EVM chain,
this will cause failure/incorrect result because  of the value being truncated to fit in `uint8` if it doesn't reverts. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make the evm-contract's exitCode of `uint32` type.
