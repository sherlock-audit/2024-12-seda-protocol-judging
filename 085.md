# Unnecessary Use Of Payable Keyword in postResult :: SedaCoreV1 May Lead to Permanently Locked Funds

## Summary
The `postResult` function in `SedaCoreV1.sol` is marked as payable, allowing users to send ETH along with their transaction. However, the function does not utilize ETH in any way, and there is no mechanism to withdraw mistakenly sent funds. This can result in users accidentally locking ETH in the contract with no way to recover it.

## Vulnerability Details

- The  [postResult]( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122-L126)  function is payable, meaning users can send ETH when calling it.

- The function does not process or utilize ETH, nor does it forward or refund any received ETH.

```javascript
    function postResult(
        SedaDataTypes.Result calldata result,
        uint64 batchHeight,
        bytes32[] calldata proof
    ) public payable override(ResultHandlerBase, IResultHandler) whenNotPaused returns (bytes32) {
    ......} 
``` 
- There is no withdrawal function in the contract to retrieve stuck ETH.

- If a user mistakenly sends ETH while calling `postResult`, the funds will be trapped permanently in the contract.


## Impact

- Any ETH mistakenly sent to `postResult` will be irretrievable, leading to user fund loss.

- Over time, this could accumulate significant amounts of ETH in the contract, making it a black hole for funds.

- Users may unknowingly lose funds if they assume ETH sent with the function call is handled correctly.

## POC
1. Add this test case inside `SedaCoreV1.test.ts` within the `describe('postResult')` block.
2. Use the command `bun run test` to execute the test.
```javascript
it.only('Msg.value send to with postResult cannot be recovered ', async () => {
      const { core, data } = await loadFixture(deployCoreFixture);

      await core.postRequest(data.requests[0]);
      let requests = await core.getPendingRequests(0, 1);
      console.log("Before posting result balance of contract: ", await ethers.provider.getBalance(core.getAddress()));

      await core.postResult(data.results[0], 0, data.proofs[0], { value: ethers.parseEther('1.0') });
      const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(core.getAddress());
      console.log("After posting result balance of contract: ", balance.toString());
      console.log("Balance cannot be recovered");
      expect(balance).to.equal(ethers.parseEther('1.0'));
    });
```

## Recommendation

- Remove the payable keyword from the `postResult` function since ETH is not required.

- If the function must remain payable for future use cases, implement a withdrawal mechanism to allow the contract owner or users to reclaim mistakenly sent ETH.
