# Creating a vesting account can be perpetually disallowed

### Summary

Creating a vesting account can be perpetually disallowed

### Root Cause

Upon calling `msg_server::CreateVestingAccount()`, we have this piece of code:
```go
	if acc := m.ak.GetAccount(ctx, to); acc != nil {
		return nil, sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrapf("account %s already exists", msg.ToAddress)
	}
```
If the account already exists, then we will return an error, the vesting will not be possible. This can be abused by malicious entities, perpetually disallowing usage of the functionality.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Bob wants to create a vesting account for address `X` for 1000 tokens
2. Alice frontruns him and creates a vesting account for address `X` for 0 tokens (I believe this is possible but if I missed something, then she can do the same but by sending 1 token)
3. Bob's transaction will fail
4. Alice can do it over and over again for different users and different addresses

### Impact

The functionality to create a vesting account will be completely useless, users can be perpetually disallowed from using it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum vesting amount and check against it.
