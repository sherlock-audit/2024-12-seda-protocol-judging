# Missing Execution Timeout (WASM VM)



## Summary
The WASM VM lacks a wall-clock timeout mechanism rely so much on gas limits to halt execution. Malicious WASM programs can exploit low-gas loops to run indefinitely causing denial-of-service attack.

## Vulnerability Details 
The WASM VM rely on gas metering to terminate execution. While gas limit computational steps, it does not force any real-time execution duration so a malicious or even buggy WASM program can execute an infinite loop with minimal gas cost per iteration can bypass gas exhaustion and running indefinitely.

Considering the Flow Mechanism
The WASM program start through internal_run_vm in runtime contract:
```solidity 
let runtime_result = main_func.call(&mut context.wasm_store, &[]);  
```

Then call the WASM function (either _start or tally) without a timeout 
Now gas is initialized 
```solidity
// runtime_context.rs  
let mut engine = Singlepass::default();  
if let Some(gas_limit) = call_data.gas_limit {  
    let metering = Metering::new(gas_limit, get_wasm_operation_gas_cost);  
    engine.push_middleware(metering);  
}  
```
so gas is deducted per WASM operation in the metering contract.

The execution stop only when gas is exhausted defining that  (gas_used >= gas_limit) as no check for wall-clock time 5 seconds.

Now looking at the Vulnerability in Code Flow
- Critical Gap:

```rust

// runtime.rs  
let runtime_result = main_func.call(&mut context.wasm_store, &[]);
```  
The call lack a timeout wrapper allowing unlimited execution time.
- looking at the Gas vs. Time:
A loop like while true { x += 1;} cost minimal gas per iteration for example 115 gas per loop for example with gas_limit = 1,000,000, the loop could run for 8,695 iterations based on the calculation of (1,000,000 / 115) potentially taking hours as each iteration is slow.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)  
An attacker exploit the lack of a wall-clock timeout in the SEDA WASM VM by deploying a malicious WASM program that executes an infinite loop. The loop consume minimal gas per iteration allowing it to run indefinitely and exhaust system resources leading to DoS..

**Step-by-Step Exploitation**

1. Attacker write a WebAssembly (WASM) loop script  to run loop endlessly. The program use a simple loop structure to minimize gas consumption per iteration for example in WAT:
   ```wat
   (module
     (func $infinite_loop
       (loop
         (br 0)  ; Branch to the start of the loop
       )
     )
     (export "tally" (func $infinite_loop))  ; Export as the entrypoint
   )
   ```  
   - The `loop` and `br 0` instructions create an infinite loop.  
   - The function is exported as `tally` as expected entrypoint for VM execution.

2. The attacker compile the WAT code to a WASM binary using `wat2wasm`:  
   ```bash
   wat2wasm infinite_loop.wat -o infinite_loop.wasm
   ```  
   This generate a binary (infinite_loop.wasm) that the VM execute.

3. The attacker submit the WASM binary as part of a transaction which is a data request to the SEDA network. The transaction set a high gas limit (gas_limit = 1,000,000) allowing the loop to run for an extended period.

4. The VM execute the `tally` function from the malicious binary:  
   - Each loop iteration cost 115 gas (from `GAS_PER_OPERATION` in metering contract).  
     - With gas_limit = 1,000,000, the loop run for 8,695 iterations as it is (1,000,000 / 115).  
   - Since there is no wall-clock timeout, the loop execute indefinitely until gas is exhausted.  

5. The VM thread run the loop consume 100% CPU resources and when multiple nodes execute the malicious loop script deployed by many attackers,  the network suffer from a widespread resource exhaustion (causing it to hang) and legitimate transactions are blocked causing a network-wide DoS.


## **Impact**  
CPU usage  spike to 100% blocking other transactions and node operators incuring higher operational costs and also validators are unable to process legitimate requests.






## **Recommendation**  
Add a timeout to terminate execution after a fixed duration (5 seconds) regardless of gas usage.
