# WASI imports can be exploited for unmetered execution or unbounded memory growth

### Summary

All the WASI imports do not call `apply_gas_cost()`, so they do not do any metering. For example, [`fd_write`](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/blob/e3ea3af23dc27cc28e7b140eb10d4d9b989bc14d/lib/wasix/src/syscalls/wasi/fd_write.rs#L11-L64) does not do any metering. Any attacker can exploit this unmetered execution because there is no cost to the attacker. This impacts validators by draining their resources, whether CPU or memory, and can lead to chain delays or Chain Halts, in the worst case.


### Root Cause

WASI objects are [imported](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/vm_imports.rs#L44-L46) as-is direct from the WASI environment.

```rust
pub fn create_wasm_imports(
    store: &mut Store,
    vm_context: &FunctionEnv<VmContext>,
    wasi_env: &WasiFunctionEnv,
    wasm_module: &Module,
    call_data: &VmCallData,
) -> Result<Imports> {
    // @audit the WASI environment's import objects
    let wasi_import_obj = wasi_env.import_object(store, wasm_module)?;
    // ... snip ...

    for allowed_import in allowed_imports.iter() {
        // "env" is all our custom host imports
        if let Some(found_export) = custom_imports.get_export("seda_v1", allowed_import) {
            allowed_host_exports.insert(allowed_import.to_string(), found_export);
        } else if let Some(wasi_version) = wasi_version {
            // When we couldn't find a match in our custom import we try WASI imports
            // WASI has different versions of compatibility so it depends how the WASM was
            // build, that's why we use wasi_verison to determine the correct export
            // @audit the WASI import objects are imported as-is
            if let Some(found_export) = wasi_import_obj.get_export(wasi_version.get_namespace_str(), allowed_import) {
                allowed_wasi_exports.insert(allowed_import.to_string(), found_export);
            }
        }
    }
```

Since the WASI import objects are imported as-is, they do not do any metering. These imported functions must be wrapped in a new
that applies gas metering. 

Below is a list of all the [WASI imports](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/safe_wasi_imports.rs#L3-L21).

```rust
"args_get",
"args_sizes_get",
"proc_exit",
"fd_write",
"environ_get",
"environ_sizes_get",
```

### Attack Path
1. The Attacker creates a WASM program that exploits the unmetered execution of any WASI imports.
The program will call a WASI import in a loop for as long as gas is available (they only need to pay for the gas for the loop).
2. The Attacker then compiles the WASM program and deploys the binary via [`StoreOracleProgram()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/wasm-storage/keeper/msg_server.go#L34-L96).
3. The Attacker posts a Data Request that will execute their earlier deployed Tally Program.
4. Once the Data Request is for tallying, it will be processed in the Tally module's [`EndBlock()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L22-L41).
5. When [executing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L210) the Attacker's Tally Program, the unmetered execution can delay block building significantly.

This unmetered execution can be compounded by performing the same attack with many data requests, which can cause greater delays in block building.


### Impact
Delay block building, possibly to the point of chain halt.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider wrapping WASI imports in import objects that call `apply_gas_cost()`.
