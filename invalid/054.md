# Allowlist does not prevent previous stakers from participation

### Summary

Any staker who was active before the allowlist was enabled will remain active.

### Root Cause

The allowlist is disabled during the core contract [instantiation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/contract.rs#L50-L54):

```rust
    let init_staking_config = msg.staking_config.unwrap_or(StakingConfig {
        minimum_stake_to_register:               INITIAL_MINIMUM_STAKE_TO_REGISTER,
        minimum_stake_for_committee_eligibility: INITIAL_MINIMUM_STAKE_FOR_COMMITTEE_ELIGIBILITY,
@>      allowlist_enabled:                       false,
    });
```

This allows anyone to join as executors by calling [`stake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L7). In case the contract owner decides to enable allowlist later, this will not lead to the expulsion of existing stakers:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/set_staking_config.rs#L8-L26

Moreover, during the commit request validation, the only requirement enforced is to have enough stake:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L58-L65

This allows stakers who staked before the allowlist was enabled to stay active and execute requests.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. Allowlist is enabled after a period of being disabled.

### Attack Path

1. Core contract deployed (allowlist: false)
2. Users stake enough amount to be executors
3. Core contract owner enables allowlist
4. Users staked at step 2 remain active

### Impact

Allowlist functionality can be front-run during deployment. An alternative attack path also exists if allowlist is repeatedly disabled and then re-enabled at any time during the contract lifetime.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Create a contract with allowlist enabled by default.
2. Clean the current list of stakers when the allowlist is re-enabled.
