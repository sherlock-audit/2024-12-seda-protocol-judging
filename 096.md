# `addGenesisAccountCmd` function never verifies that the vesting start time occurs before the vesting end time

The bug is that the code never verifies that the vesting start time occurs before the vesting end time. This missing validation can allow an account to be configured with an inverted vesting schedule, which could lead to unexpected or exploitable behavior in how funds vest.

In the [code snippet below](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/genaccounts.go#L82-L89), vesting parameters are read and checked only for being nonzero:
[Here too](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/genaccounts.go#L117-L125)
```go
vestingStart, err := cmd.Flags().GetInt64(flagVestingStart)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
vestingEnd, err := cmd.Flags().GetInt64(flagVestingEnd)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

// ...

if vestingEnd != 0 && vestingStart != 0 {
    funder, err := cmd.Flags().GetString(flagFunder)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    funderAddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(funder)
    if err != nil {
        return errors.New("funder of vesting account must be provided using from flag")
    }
    genAccount = vestingtypes.NewClawbackContinuousVestingAccountRaw(baseVestingAccount, vestingStart, funderAddr.String())
} else {
    return errors.New("invalid vesting parameters; must supply start and end time or end time")
}
```
There is no check to ensure that `vestingStart < vestingEnd`. Without this, a user could mistakenly (or maliciously) set the vesting start time to a value later than the vesting end time. An inverted schedule might lead to a scenario where funds vest immediately, defeating the purpose of a vesting mechanism. The clawback vesting account’s behavior might become unpredictable, potentially allowing unauthorized access or causing funds to remain locked indefinitely.

## Root Cause
The primary root cause is the lack of proper input validation for the vesting parameters—specifically, the code only checks that the vesting start and end times are nonzero, but it does not verify that the start time is less than the end time. This omission allows an inverted vesting schedule to be created, leading to misconfigurations that could disrupt the intended vesting behavior.

## Impact
Without enforcing that the vesting start time comes before the vesting end time, an account can be configured with an inverted vesting schedule. This misconfiguration could allow funds to vest improperly—either being unlocked too early or not at all—which may enable unauthorized access to funds or disrupt the intended vesting mechanism.

## Mitigation
add an explicit check to ensure that the vesting start time is less than the vesting end time.
