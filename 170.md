# The verifyBatchSignatures function may trigger an index out-of-range panic for consensus nodes, due to missing lower-bound check

### Summary

The missing lower-bound check on the signature length will cause a runtime panic for consensus nodes as verifyBatchSignatures will attempt to slice a vote extension that may be shorter than 65 bytes.

### Root Cause

In [abci/handlers.go:verifyBatchSignatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L343-L396), the function slices the vote extension with `voteExtension[:65]` without verifying that `len(voteExtension) >= 65`, which can lead to an out-of-range access if the vote extension is malformed or truncated.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A node receives a vote extension whose length is less than 65 bytes.  
2. The verifyBatchSignatures function is called with this insufficiently long vote extension.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A malicious or misconfigured validator submits a malformed vote extension (length < 65 bytes).  
2. The verifyBatchSignatures function attempts to extract the signature using `voteExtension[:65]`.  
3. An index out-of-range panic is triggered, potentially crashing the node or halting the consensus process.

### Impact

The affected consensus node may crash or experience a denial of service, disrupting the normal operation of the blockchain network.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a lower-bound check before slicing the vote extension. For example, verify that `len(voteExtension) >= 65` and handle the error appropriately if the check fails.
