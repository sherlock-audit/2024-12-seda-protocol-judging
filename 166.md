# Withdrawal Recipient Mismatch Allows Unauthorized Fund Redirection

In the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L6-L55) function, the contract verifies a withdrawal using a provided public key and a corresponding signature without ensuring that the message sender (`info.sender`)—who receives the withdrawn funds—is bound to the verified public key. The verification is performed as follows:  
```rust
let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
```
After verification, the contract constructs a bank message that sends the tokens to `info.sender`:  
```rust
let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
    to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
    amount: coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
};
```
Since there is no check to ensure that the address derived from the public key matches `info.sender`, a malicious actor who obtains a valid signature from a staker could supply their own address as `info.sender` and redirect the withdrawal funds.

#### Root Cause
The contract fails to bind the withdrawal recipient (`info.sender`) to the verified public key by omitting a check that ensures the signature's owner corresponds to the sender’s address.

#### Impact
This vulnerability enables an attacker to redirect funds intended for the legitimate staker, leading to unauthorized fund transfers and direct financial loss.

#### Mitigation
Enforce a check that validates `info.sender` against the address derived from the verified public key before processing the withdrawal.
