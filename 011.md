# The increaseFees function is not restricted and should apply onlyOwner access control

## **Missing Access Control in `increaseFees`**

**Impact:**  
The `increaseFees` function is intended to be restricted to the contract owner but lacks an access control modifier. In the current implementation, **any user can call** `increaseFees` to modify fees on **any pending request** ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:206-227](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206-L227)). This could lead to unauthorized fee manipulation: a malicious user might arbitrarily increase fee values for requests. While the caller must supply the additional fee value (preventing direct theft of funds), this oversight violates the principle of least privilege and could result in unexpected state changes or event emissions. For example, an attacker could erroneously trigger fee-increase logic on requests they don't own, potentially confusing requestors or affecting how solvers perceive available fees.

**POC:**  
Below is a simplified PoC demonstrating that a non-owner can call `increaseFees` due to missing access control. In this scenario, `attacker` is any arbitrary address that is **not** the contract owner: 

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SedaTest {

SedaCoreV1 public seda; 
bytes32 public targetRequestId;

setup() public {
        seda = SedaCoreV1(_sedaCoreAddress);
        targetRequestId = _requestId;
    }
    
function testExploitIncreaseFees() public {
        // Attacker calls increaseFees on someone else's request.
        // No access control means this will succeed as long as msg.value matches the fees.
        vm.startPrank(address(0xfeeFDeeF));
        seda.increaseFees{value: 0}(targetRequestId, 0, 0, 0);
        // Since all additional fees are 0 and msg.value is 0, this call goes through 
        // and emits FeesIncreased even though caller is not owner.
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
``` 

In the above PoC, the attacker calls `increaseFees` with `additionalRequestFee`, `additionalResultFee`, and `additionalBatchFee` all set to 0 (so no payment required). This call **succeeds** and triggers the `FeesIncreased` event for the `targetRequestId` despite the caller not being the owner. The lack of `onlyOwner` or similar check allows this unauthorized interaction ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:211](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L211)).

**Mitigation:**  
Restrict `increaseFees` to only authorized addresses (e.g., the contract owner) by adding an access control modifier. Using OpenZeppelin’s Ownable, we can add the `onlyOwner` modifier to the function. Additionally, update the function’s NatSpec comment if needed to accurately reflect the access control. For example: 

```solidity
contract SedaCoreV1 is OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    // ... (other code)

    /// @dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request  
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
    ) external payable onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }
        // ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
    }
}
``` 

Adding `onlyOwner` ensures that only the contract owner can call this function, enforcing the intended access control. This prevents arbitrary external accounts from invoking `increaseFees`. If the protocol design actually intended this to be open to anyone, the mitigation would instead be to **correct the misleading comment** to reflect that (though given the sensitive nature of altering fees, restricting to owner is recommended).
