# Malicious staker will manipulate the unstake mechanism and replication factor

### Summary

The  contract's unstake functionality does not enforce a  rule: a staker's remaining stake after unstaking must either be **at least the `minimum_stake_to_register`** or **exactly zero**. This oversight allows stakers to enter an invalid state where their remaining stake is below the minimum required but not zero. Additionally, the replication factor is checked against the total number of stakers rather than active stakers, enabling malicious users to flood the system with invalid stakers and data requests that cannot be fulfilled. This results in wasted computational resources and potential system abuse.


### Root Cause

1. **Unstake Functionality Oversight**:  
   The unstake function does not validate that a staker's remaining stake is either zero or above the `minimum_stake_to_register`. This allows stakers to remain in an invalid state with a negligible stake (e.g., 1 token).

2. **Replication Factor Miscalculation**:  
   The replication factor is checked against the total number of stakers instead of the number of active stakers. This allows the system to accept data requests that cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient active stakers.

3.  **Commit and Reveal Mechanism** :  

The `reveal_started` function checks whether the number of commits meets the required `replication_factor`. If this condition is satisfied, the reveal process can begin. However, for requests where the `replication_factor` exceeds the number of active stakers, the reveal process will never start. This is because only active stakers are allowed to participate in the commit phase, and if there aren't enough active stakers to meet the `replication_factor`, the reveal phase cannot be initiated.

A malicious user can exploit this condition to create an unlimited number of requests where the reveal phase will never start.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The unstake function does not enforce the `minimum_stake_to_register` rule for remaining stakes.
2. The replication factor is calculated based on the total number of stakers, not active stakers.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Malicious users can unstake tokens to leave a negligible remaining stake (e.g., 1 token).
2. Malicious users can register as stakers with minimal stakes (e.g., 1 token) to inflate the staker list.
3. Malicious users can submit data requests with a replication factor higher than the number of active stakers.

### Attack Path

1. **Step 1**: A malicious user stakes a minimal amount to register as a staker.
2. **Step 2**: The user unstakes most of their tokens, leaving a negligible remaining stake (e.g., 1 token), entering an invalid state.
3. **Step 3**: The user repeats this process to inflate the staker list with invalid stakers.
4. **Step 4**: The user submits data requests with a replication factor higher than the number of active stakers.
5. **Step 5**: Validators process these requests, but the reveal phase never starts due to insufficient active stakers.
6. **Step 6**: The system wastes computational resources processing invalid requests, and malicious users can flood the system with such requests.

### Impact

* Malicious users can flood the system with invalid stakers and data requests.
* Validators  will commit and process the request but the reveal phase will never start.

### Mitigation

1. **Enforce Minimum Stake Rule in Unstake Functionality**:  
   Ensure that after unstaking, a staker's remaining stake is either zero or at least the `minimum_stake_to_register`.
   ```rust
   if remaining_stake > 0 && remaining_stake < minimum_stake_to_register {
       return Err(ContractError::InvalidRemainingStake);
   }
   ```

2. **Check Replication Factor Against Active Stakers**:  
   Modify the replication factor check to consider only active stakers.
   ```rust
   let active_stakers = STAKERS.get_active_stakers(deps.storage)?;
   if self.posted_dr.replication_factor as u32 > active_stakers.len() {
       return Err(ContractError::DataRequestReplicationFactorTooHigh(active_stakers.len()));
   }
   ```
