# Posting results can be blocked in `SedaCoreV1` due to using the push pattern

### Summary

Posting results can be blocked in `SedaCoreV1` due to using the push pattern

### Root Cause

Upon posting results using `SedaCoreV1::postResult()`, we conduct a few native token transfers - to the payback address, the batch sender and a refund to the requestor. All of them are done with the following code:
```solidity
    function _transferFee(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed();
    }
```
As this directly transfers the funds to the according entity, they can simply revert in the `receive` function. Then, posting a request will be completely impossible.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No internal pre-conditions_

### External Pre-conditions

_No external pre-conditions_

### Attack Path

The issue can happen due to a revert by any of the receiving parties, thus there are multiple attack paths.

Let's imagine the most simple one where the requestor reverts in his `receive` function. If that happens, then the payback address will not receive anything for his work. Afterwards, the requestor can call `SedaCoreV1::withdrawTimedOutRequest()` to claim his funds after the timeout.

The payback address owner can also do the same thing which will be a grief attack disallowing finalizing the results.

### Impact

Posting the result of a request can be made impossible due to using the push pattern.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a pull over push pattern.
