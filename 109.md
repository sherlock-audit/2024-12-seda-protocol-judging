# Without proper memo validation, genesis transactions can lead to the injection of attacker-controlled network endpoints.

This issue stems from the use of the transaction’s memo field to capture and later set the node’s peer information without proper validation. This memo field is expected to hold a string in the format `"nodeID@IP:port"` and is later aggregated into the persistent peers list. However, there is no check to ensure that the memo adheres to this format or even represents a valid network endpoint.

## Vulnerability details

> #### Extraction of Peer Information:
   In the [CollectTxs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/gentx/collect_gentxs.go#L183-L187) function, after a gentx is successfully parsed, the code retrieves the memo using a type assertion:
   ```go
   memoTx, ok := genTx.(sdk.TxWithMemo)
   if !ok {
       return appGenTxs, persistentPeers, fmt.Errorf("expected TxWithMemo, got %T", genTx)
   }
   nodeAddrIP := memoTx.GetMemo()
   ```
Here, the memo is assumed to contain a valid node address (e.g., `"528fd3df22b31f4969b05652bfe8f0fe921321d5@192.168.2.37:26656"`). There is no verification to confirm that the string actually matches this expected structure.

> #### Aggregation into Persistent Peers:
   Later, if the validator’s moniker does not match the node’s own moniker, the memo string is appended directly to the list of persistent peers:
   ```go
   if msg.Description.Moniker != moniker {
       addressesIPs = append(addressesIPs, nodeAddrIP)
   }
   ```
   The resulting string is later used to configure the node’s persistent peers:
   ```go
   persistentPeers = strings.Join(addressesIPs, ",")
   config.P2P.PersistentPeers = persistentPeers
   cfg.WriteConfigFile(filepath.Join(config.RootDir, "config", "config.toml"), config)
   ```

## Root Cause
  The memo field is completely unvalidated. This means that a malicious actor could craft a gentx with a memo field containing arbitrary or malformed data. There’s no mechanism to enforce that it is in the correct `"nodeID@IP:port"` format or that the IP and port are valid.
If an attacker supplies an invalid or malicious address, the node could be forced to attempt connections to unintended or attacker-controlled endpoints.


## Mitigation
It is essential to add robust validation for the memo field. For instance, the code should verify that the memo string matches a strict pattern (using a regular expression or a parsing function) before it’s accepted.
