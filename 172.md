# Improper Handling of Missing Validator Tree Entry in ExtendVoteHandler

### Summary

The absence of proper handling for missing validator tree entries will cause unexpected consensus errors for new validators, as ExtendVoteHandler incorrectly returns an error when a validator has just joined the active set.

### Root Cause

In [abci/handlers.go:ExtendVoteHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L75-L133), when the lookup for the validator tree entry returns `collections.ErrNotFound`, the code logs an informational message and then returns an error instead of gracefully skipping the signing process. This behavior is problematic for validators that are newly added to the active set and do not have an entry in the previous validator tree.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A validator that has recently joined the active set does not have an entry in the previous validator tree.  
2. ExtendVoteHandler is invoked for such a validator during the batch signing phase.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A new validator triggers the ExtendVoteHandler.  
2. The validator’s absence in the previous tree is detected (i.e. `collections.ErrNotFound` is returned).  
3. Instead of handling this case benignly, the handler returns an error, causing the signing process to fail.  
4. This failure can propagate, leading to potential consensus disruption or misbehavior penalties for the new validator.

### Impact

New validators might be penalized or inadvertently cause consensus failures due to the improper handling of the missing validator tree entry.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Revisit the error handling logic in ExtendVoteHandler. Adjust the handler to treat a missing validator tree entry as a benign condition—return an empty response or skip signing—if the validator is new, rather than propagating an error.
