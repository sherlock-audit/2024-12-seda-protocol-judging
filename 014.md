# Unvalidated gasLimit When creating a new request via postRequest in SedaCoreV1.sol

## **Unvalidated `gasLimit` in Request Creation**

**Impact:**  
When creating a new request via `postRequest`, the contract sets the request’s `gasLimit` as the sum of `execGasLimit` and `tallyGasLimit` provided in the input ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:gasLimit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L114)). However, there is **no validation** on these values. This means a user could create a request with an extremely low (or even zero) gas limit or an absurdly high gas limit without any checks. 

Consequences of not validating `gasLimit` include:
- A **zero gas limit** leads to the *Division by Zero* issue described in Issue 2, rendering the request unresolvable.
- An **excessively high gas limit** skews the fee distribution. For example, if `gasLimit` is set unrealistically high, the solver’s portion `(gasUsed/gasLimit)` of the request fee becomes nearly zero, meaning almost the entire `requestFee` would be refunded to the requestor. This could be abused by a dishonest requestor to lure solvers with a high posted fee that, due to the large gasLimit, largely gets returned to the requestor. Solvers could waste effort for little reward if they don't notice the imbalance.
- In general, lack of input sanitization can lead to unpredictable behavior or edge cases that the protocol did not intend to support.

**POC:**  
Below is an example of creating a malicious request with a problematic gas limit. We demonstrate both a zero gas limit case and an extremely high gas limit case:

```solidity
// Zero gasLimit example:
seda.postRequest(
    SedaDataTypes.RequestInputs({
        /* other required fields */, 
        execGasLimit: 0, 
        tallyGasLimit: 0
    }),
    1 ether, 0, 0,
    {value: 1 ether}
);
// This request is accepted and stored with gasLimit = 0, which will cause issues when a result is posted (as shown in Issue 2).

// Excessively high gasLimit example:
seda.postRequest(
    SedaDataTypes.RequestInputs({
        /* fields */,
        execGasLimit: 1_000_000_000,  // very high gas limits
        tallyGasLimit: 1_000_000_000
    }),
    0.5 ether, 0, 0,
    {value: 0.5 ether}
);
// gasLimit = 2,000,000,000 (2 billion). A solver might assume 0.5 ETH is the reward, 
// but if the actual gas used is, say, 100k, their payout = (100k / 2e9) * 0.5 ETH ≈ 0.000025 ETH, 
// and the rest (~0.499975 ETH) is refunded to the requestor.
```

In these examples, the contract happily accepts the inputs without complaint. The first call creates a future division-by-zero trap. The second call shows how a requestor could maliciously set a huge gas limit to reclaim nearly all the fees, effectively tricking solvers.

**Mitigation:**  
Validate the `gasLimit` (and its components) on request creation. The contract should enforce that the combined gas limit is reasonable and non-zero. At minimum, require it to be > 0. Optionally, set an upper bound if the protocol has a concept of maximum gas that could ever be used. For instance:

```solidity
uint256 totalGasLimit = inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit;
if (totalGasLimit == 0) {
    revert InvalidGasLimit();  // gas limit must be positive
}
uint256 MAX_GAS_LIMIT = 10_000_000; // example upper bound (adjust as appropriate)
// (The MAX_GAS_LIMIT value should be decided based on system constraints)
if (totalGasLimit > MAX_GAS_LIMIT) {
    revert InvalidGasLimit();  // gas limit unreasonably high
}
_storageV1().requestDetails[requestId] = RequestDetails({
    requestor: msg.sender,
    timestamp: block.timestamp,
    requestFee: requestFee,
    resultFee: resultFee,
    batchFee: batchFee,
    gasLimit: totalGasLimit
});
``` 

By adding the above checks in `postRequest`, any request with a zero or out-of-range gas limit is rejected early. This ensures data integrity for subsequent logic. It prevents the creation of requests that would break fee calculations or be used to exploit fee distribution. The upper bound (`MAX_GAS_LIMIT`) is optional but recommended to prevent extreme values that have no practical use and could be used maliciously.
