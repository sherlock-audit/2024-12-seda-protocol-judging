# user can refuse request done

### Summary

# Summary

```solidity
// Aggregate refund to requestor containing:
// - unused request fees (when gas used < gas limit)
// - full request fee (when invalid payback address)
// - batch fee (when no batch sender)
if (refundAmount > 0) {
  _transferFee(requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount);
  emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, requestDetails.requestor, refundAmount, ISedaCore.FeeType.REFUND);
}
```

The `postResult` function sends the remaining amount to `requestDetails.requestor` after excluding requestFee, submitterFee, etc.

```solidity
/// @dev Helper function to safely transfer fees
/// @param recipient Address to receive the fee
/// @param amount Amount to transfer
function _transferFee(address recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
  // Using low-level call instead of transfer()
  (bool success, ) = payable(recipient).call{value: amount}("");
  if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed();
}

```

In the case of _transferFee, the call function sends the specified amount, and if the recipient address does not accept ether, a revert occurs, causing the transaction to be rolled back. This allows the user to avoid paying fees and disrupts the normal operation of the SEDA CHAIN fee distribution mechanism.

After some time, if a revert occurs in the transferFee function, the user can receive all fees by using the withdrawTimedOutRequest function.

Additionally, if such requests increase, it is possible to fetch the processed records through the getPendingRequests function, which introduces the potential for DoS attacks off-chain.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L356-L360

there is no method when user reverted receiving ether

### Internal Pre-conditions

nothing

### External Pre-conditions

1. contract must call function postRequest.
2. contract must be reverted when receive ether.

### Attack Path

1. contract call postRequest when revert receiving ether.

### Impact

if such requests increase, it is possible to fetch the processed records through the getPendingRequests function, which introduces the potential for DoS attacks off-chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

# Recommended mitigation steps

If the recipient cannot receive ether, store the fee in the storage so it can be retrieved later.
