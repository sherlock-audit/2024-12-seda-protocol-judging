# In the fee distribution logic of postResult the contract divides by the requests gasLimit when calculating the solvers fee share which can lead to zero division

## **Division by Zero in `postResult`**

**Impact:**  
In the fee distribution logic of `postResult`, the contract divides by the request’s `gasLimit` when calculating the solver’s fee share: 

```solidity
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
``` 

If `requestDetails.gasLimit` is zero, this operation will **revert due to a division-by-zero error** ([2024-12-seda-protocol/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:162](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L162)). A zero gas limit could arise if a request is created with `execGasLimit + tallyGasLimit == 0`. The immediate impact is a denial-of-service for that specific request: no result can be posted because any attempt triggers a revert. Funds for the request remain locked until a timeout allows withdrawal. This also wastes gas for any solver who attempts to finalize the request. In summary, a request with `gasLimit == 0` becomes unresolvable through `postResult`, breaking the expected request-response flow.

**POC:**  
The following snippet illustrates the problematic scenario. We simulate a request with a zero gas limit and then attempt to call `postResult`, resulting in a runtime error:

```solidity
// Assume we have a SedaCoreV1 instance `seda` and a crafted request with gasLimit = 0.
bytes32 requestId = seda.postRequest(
    SedaDataTypes.RequestInputs({ /* execGasLimit */ 0, /* tallyGasLimit */ 0, /* other params */ }), 
    1 ether, 0, 0,
    {value: 1 ether}
);
// The above creates a request with requestFee=1 ether and gasLimit = 0 + 0 = 0.

bool success;
bytes memory data;
(result, success) = address(seda).call(
    abi.encodeWithSignature(
        "postResult((bytes32,bytes payload, bytes32 paybackAddress,uint64 gasUsed,uint256 blockTimestamp),uint64,bytes32[])",
        SedaDataTypes.Result({
            drId: requestId,
            payload: bytes("fake result"),
            paybackAddress: bytes32(uint256(uint160(msg.sender))),  // valid payback address
            gasUsed: 100,    // arbitrary gas usage
            blockTimestamp: uint64(block.timestamp)
        }),
        0,
        new bytes32[](0)
    )
);
// The call will revert internally because submitterFee calculation attempts to divide by requestDetails.gasLimit (which is 0).
require(success, "postResult failed due to division by zero");
``` 

In this PoC, `postRequest` is called with both `execGasLimit` and `tallyGasLimit` as 0, creating a request with `gasLimit = 0`. When `postResult` is invoked for this request, the division by `gasLimit` causes a revert, demonstrated by the call failing the `require(success)` check.

**Mitigation:**  
To prevent this issue, enforce that gas limit must be non-zero before using it in arithmetic. There are two layers of defense:
1. **Validate on Request Creation:** Reject any request with a zero total gas limit.
2. **Validate on Result Posting:** Double-check the stored gasLimit before division.

For example, add a check during request creation: 

```solidity
// In postRequest (on creating a new request)
uint256 totalGasLimit = inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit;
if (totalGasLimit == 0) {
    revert InvalidGasLimit();  // ensure gasLimit is non-zero
}
_storageV1().requestDetails[requestId] = RequestDetails({
    // ...
    gasLimit: totalGasLimit
});
``` 

And in `postResult`, explicitly guard the division to provide a clear error if ever triggered: 

```solidity
function postResult(... ) public override returns (bytes32) {
    RequestDetails memory requestDetails = _storageV1().requestDetails[result.drId];
    require(requestDetails.gasLimit != 0, "Invalid gas limit"); 
    // Prevent division by zero
    
    uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit;
    // ... rest of the fee distribution logic
}
``` 

With these checks, any attempt to post a result on a request with an invalid (zero) gas limit is preemptively stopped with a clear error. This ensures the contract fails safely and early, and ideally such a request would not exist in the first place due to the creation-time validation.
