# Anyone can front-run the creation of a vesting account to block it

### Summary

Creation of a vesting account will not work when the recipient of the vested funds [already exists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/vesting/keeper/msg_server.go#L56-L58). Anyone can then block a new vesting account from being created by front-running it with a [`Bank::Msg.Send`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/x/bank/keeper/msg_server.go#L29-L83).

### Root Cause

A vesting account can only be created if the recipient [does not exist](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/vesting/keeper/msg_server.go#L56-L58) yet.

```golang
if acc := m.ak.GetAccount(ctx, to); acc != nil {
  return nil, sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest.Wrapf("account %s already exists", msg.ToAddress)
}
```

This can be exploited by anyone that [sends coins](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/x/bank/keeper/send.go#L226-L234) to the intended vesting recipient.

```golang
func (k BaseSendKeeper) SendCoins(ctx context.Context, fromAddr, toAddr sdk.AccAddress, amt sdk.Coins) error {
  // ... snip ... 
 
	// Create account if recipient does not exist.
	//
	// NOTE: This should ultimately be removed in favor a more flexible approach
	// such as delegated fee messages.
	accExists := k.ak.HasAccount(ctx, toAddr)
	if !accExists {
		defer telemetry.IncrCounter(1, "new", "account")
		k.ak.SetAccount(ctx, k.ak.NewAccountWithAddress(ctx, toAddr))
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. A user calls `CreateVestingAccount()` with `pubkeyB` as the intended recipient.
2. The griefer frontruns the `CreateVestingAccount()` transaction with Bank [`Send()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/x/bank/keeper/msg_server.go#L29-L83) transaction.
This transaction creates the recipient account causing the `CreateVestingAccount()` to fail.


### Impact

The intended recipient of the vesting funds is permanently blocked from becoming a Vesting Account. Once an account is created, it can not be deleted. 


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider updating an existing account to a Vesting Account.
