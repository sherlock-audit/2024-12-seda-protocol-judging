# An account can delegate more than it actually possesses, leading to a situation where validators may appear to have more stake than exists

The core issue arises from the way the contract validates delegation transactions without updating the account’s available funds after each transaction. In the [CollectTxs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/gentx/collect_gentxs.go#L127-L231) function, every gentx is processed independently by checking that the account’s balance is sufficient for the delegation:

```go
if delBal.GetCoins().AmountOf(msg.Value.Denom).LT(msg.Value.Amount) {
    return appGenTxs, persistentPeers, fmt.Errorf(
        "insufficient fund for delegation %v: %v < %v",
        delBal.GetAddress(), delBal.GetCoins().AmountOf(msg.Value.Denom), msg.Value.Amount,
    )
}
```

### How the Bug Comes Alive
When a gentx is submitted, the function retrieves the account balance (from the genesis state) and verifies it is enough to cover the delegation amount. For instance, if an account has a balance `X` and submits a gentx delegating an amount `Y`, the check passes if `X ≥ Y`.  After the validation, the code does not deduct the delegated funds from the balance. This means the balance `X` remains unchanged in the in-memory map (`balancesMap`).
   If the same account submits another gentx with a delegation amount `Z`, the function again checks against the original balance `X`. Even if `Y + Z > X`, each gentx individually passes because each check is performed in isolation against `X`. There’s no mechanism to track cumulative delegations.

   Imagine:
   - **First gentx:** Delegates `Y` and passes because `X ≥ Y`.
   - **Second gentx:** Delegates `Z` and passes because `X ≥ Z`.

   Even though the total delegated amount (`Y + Z`) might exceed the account’s balance `X`, the contract does not prevent this cumulative over-delegation.

## Root Cause:
The flaw is due to the absence of a mechanism that updates (or “deducts”) the account’s available balance after each successful delegation. Without decrementing the available funds, each gentx is validated against the full, unaltered balance from the genesis state.

## Impact
An account can delegate more than it actually possesses, leading to a situation where validators may appear to have more stake than exists.


## Mitigation
The implementation should deduct the delegated amount from the account’s balance immediately after processing each gentx.
