# Malicious Actor Exploits Division-by-Zero Vulnerability to Permanently Freeze Requests, Impacting Requestors and Solvers

### Summary

A lack of validation for `execGasLimit `and `tallyGasLimit `in the `postRequest `function will cause a division-by-zero error for requestors and solvers as a malicious actor will create requests with zero gas limits, rendering them unprocessable and permanently stuck in the pending state.

### Root Cause

In `SedaCoreV1.sol:122`, the lack of validation for `execGasLimit` and `tallyGasLimit `in the[ `postRequest `](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122)function is a mistake as it allows gasLimit to be zero, causing a division-by-zero error in the `postResult `function when calculating submitterFee.

Code Location:

 the `postRequest `function does not validate that `inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit > 0.`

the `postResult `function performs division by `requestDetails.gasLimit`, which can be zero.


```solidity
// In postRequest():
bytes32 requestId = RequestHandlerBase.postRequest(inputs); // No validation for gas limits

// In postResult():
uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit; // Division by zero if gasLimit = 0
```

### Internal Pre-conditions



1. **Requestor needs to call `postRequest()`** to set `inputs.execGasLimit` and `inputs.tallyGasLimit` to both be exactly `0`.  
2. **Requestor needs to call `postRequest()`** to set `gasLimit` (calculated as `execGasLimit + tallyGasLimit`) to be exactly `0`.  
3. **Solver needs to call `postResult()`** to process a request where `gasLimit` is `0`, triggering the division-by-zero error.  
4. **No validation in `postRequest()`** to ensure `execGasLimit + tallyGasLimit > 0`, allowing the above conditions to occur.

### External Pre-conditions

No external protocol dependencies are required for this vulnerability to be exploited, as it is entirely internal to the contract logic.

### Attack Path

  

1. **Malicious Actor calls `postRequest()`**:  
   - The attacker creates a request with `execGasLimit = 0` and `tallyGasLimit = 0`, resulting in `gasLimit = 0`.  
   - The request is added to the `pendingRequests` set with `RequestDetails` storing `gasLimit = 0`.  

2. **Solver calls `postResult()`**:  
   - A solver attempts to process the request by calling `postResult()` with valid result data.  
   - The contract attempts to calculate `submitterFee` using the formula:  
     ```solidity
     uint256 submitterFee = (result.gasUsed * requestDetails.requestFee) / requestDetails.gasLimit; // gasLimit = 0
     ```  
   - The division by zero causes the transaction to revert, leaving the request permanently stuck in the `pendingRequests` set.  

3. **Result**:  
   - The request cannot be processed or withdrawn, as `postResult()` will always revert due to the division-by-zero error.  
   - The attacker successfully disrupts the protocol by creating unprocessable requests, impacting both requestors and solvers.  

This attack path exploits the lack of validation in `postRequest()` and the division-by-zero vulnerability in `postResult()`.

### Impact

**Impact**:  
The **affected party (requestors and solvers)** cannot process or fulfill requests, leading to a denial of service. Specifically:  
- **Requestors** cannot retrieve results or withdraw fees for affected requests.  
- **Solvers** cannot submit results for affected requests, losing potential rewards.  

The **attacker** does not gain any direct financial benefit but causes disruption to the protocol, potentially leading to reputational damage and loss of trust in the system.  

**Approximate Loss**:  
- **Requestors**: Lose the ability to process requests, resulting in wasted gas fees and time.  
- **Solvers**: Lose potential rewards for processing requests.  
- **Protocol**: Suffers operational disruption and reputational harm.  

The attacker incurs minimal cost (gas fees for creating malicious requests) but achieves significant disruption.
