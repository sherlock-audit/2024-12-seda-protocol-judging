# deriveRequestId isnâ€™t unique on each destination chain

### Summary

The function `deriveRequestId` in `SedaDataTypes.sol` does not incorporate a destination chain identifier in the request ID derivation. This results in non-unique request IDs across different destination chains, violating a protocol constraint. Attackers or external systems relying on uniqueness may face unintended consequences due to request ID collisions.

### Root Cause

In [SedaDataTypes.sol:deriveRequestId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/libraries/SedaDataTypes.sol#L144-L160), the function derives request IDs without incorporating a unique identifier for each destination chain, violating the constraint stated in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.  

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A request is created with the same parameters but targeting different destination chains.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Multiple destination chains process requests that are identical except for the target chain.

### Attack Path

1. A user or attacker submits a request on multiple destination chains with the same input parameters.  
2. The function `deriveRequestId` produces identical request IDs.  
3. External systems relying on unique IDs fail to distinguish between requests, leading to potential conflicts or incorrect processing.  

### Impact

The protocol risks incorrect execution or misidentification of requests, potentially causing loss of funds, unintended replays, or operational failures.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `deriveRequestId` to incorporate a destination chain identifier (e.g., `chainId`) in the hashing process to ensure uniqueness.
