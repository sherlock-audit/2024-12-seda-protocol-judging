# postBatch doesnâ€™t check for duplicate signatures resulting in being able to overcome the consensus threshold

### Summary

The lack of validation for duplicate proofs and signatures in the `postBatch` function will cause an attacker to exceed the consensus threshold maliciously, allowing unauthorized batch postings.

### Root Cause

In `postBatch`, there is no check to prevent the reuse of `validatorProofs` and `signatures`, allowing the same validator's voting power to be counted multiple times.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The lastValidatorRoot includes the `validatorProof` used by the validator.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Malicious validator** submits a `postBatch` transaction.
2. **Repeats the same valid `validatorProof` and `signature` multiple times** in the `validatorProofs` and `signatures` arrays.
3. The function **does not check for duplicate usage** and sums the voting power, **artificially inflating it beyond the consensus threshold**.
4. The attacker **successfully posts an unauthorized batch** and updates the validator set.

### Impact

The protocol suffers unauthorized batch postings, compromising the integrity of consensus and potentially leading to fraudulent state transitions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure each validator's proof and signature are counted only once per batch by reverting the transaction if any validator appears more than once.
