# Request can make user double spend due to re-org or failed requests

## Description
The post request function allows users to send ETH as fees for a request. However, due to blockchain reorganizations (reorgs) or failed transactions, users can be charged multiple times or lose funds without completing the request.

```solidity

    function postRequest(
        SedaDataTypes.RequestInputs calldata inputs,
        uint256 requestFee,
        uint256 resultFee,
        uint256 batchFee
    ) public payable whenNotPaused returns (bytes32) {
        // Validate that the sent ETH matches exactly the sum of all specified fees
        // This prevents users from accidentally overpaying or underpaying fees
        if (msg.value != requestFee + resultFee + batchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }

        // Call parent contract's postRequest base implementation
        bytes32 requestId = RequestHandlerBase.postRequest(inputs);

        // Store pending request and request details
        _addRequest(requestId);
        _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId] = RequestDetails({
            requestor: msg.sender,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            requestFee: requestFee,
            resultFee: resultFee,
            batchFee: batchFee,
            gasLimit: inputs.execGasLimit + inputs.tallyGasLimit
        });

        return requestId;
    }
```
If a request payment is lost due to reorg or failed request the user loses his msg.value without a emergeny refund or withdrawal for his request.

## POC
Here there are two scenarios:
1. Re-org
- A user submits a request, and the request is included in Block 100
- A blockchain reorg happens, causing Block 100 to be replaced with a different chain.
- The user resubmits the request because their previous transaction was dropped from the chain.
- The original request is re-included later, causing the user to be charged twice for a single request.
2. Failed request 
- User calls the function with msg.value = requestFee + resultFee + batchFee.
- The _addRequest(requestId); call fails due to an issue (e.g., insufficient gas, contract state mismatch).
- The function does not revert properly, and the ETH remains locked in the contract.
- The user loses their funds, even though the request was never completed. 

## Impact
Users could pay multiple times for a single request due to failures or reorgs.
## Recommended Mitigation
Add a refund mechanism for failed requests
