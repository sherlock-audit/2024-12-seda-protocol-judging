# Commit and reveal requests can be mocked

### Summary

Commit and reveal requests can be mocked which will allow an attacker to distort the data request result, and collect rewards. Additionally, honest executors can be deemed outliers and lose rewards.

### Root Cause

When [allowlist is off](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L17-L17), stake and unstake requests are permissionless and can be executed any time. An attacker can [stake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/stake.rs#L7), [commit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs), [unstake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/unstake.rs#L8) in a single transaction and repeat this using another public key until the replication factor is reached. Then an attacker can repeat the same process with the data [reveal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/reveal_result.rs#L4) requests.

An existing implementation lacks protection mechanisms like delayed withdrawal, time locking, and stake slashing to prevent such malicious behavior. 

Such attack can lead to distorted or mocked data results, and other executors being excluded from rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Allowlist is off

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls stake, commit, unstake then repeats this process with other public keys until 2/3 of responses are done.
2. An attacker calls stake, reveal, unstake then repeats this process with other public keys until 2/3 of responses are done.
3. Data result is finalized using attackers data.
4. Honest executors do not receive rewards as they are considered outliers (1/3 of the replication factor).

### Impact

1. Mocked data results
2. Honest executors lose rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Staking / Unstaking / Withdrawal delays
2. Slashing mechanism
