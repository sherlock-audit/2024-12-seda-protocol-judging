# Malicious validators can evade slashing penalties through key switching

### Summary

Malicious validators can evade slashing penalties by signing different batches with different secp256k1 keys

### Root Cause

In `evidence.go` the double sign evidence handling only verifies that a batch was signed with the same Ethereum address that was recorded in a previous batch:
```go
validatorEthAddr, err := k.getEthAddressForBatch(ctx, evidence.BatchNumber-1, evidence.OperatorAddress)
if err != nil {
    return err
}

if !bytes.Equal(validatorEthAddr, signatureAddr) {
    return fmt.Errorf("recovered address does not match validator entry. Recorded: %s, Got: %s", hex.EncodeToString(validatorEthAddr), hex.EncodeToString(signatureAddr))
}
```
This is an issue because a malicious user can simply change their key and sign with a different keys. The following scenario illustrates the point.
Scenario:
1. block n-1: validator A signs batch m-1 with key k1
2. block n: validator A signs both batch m_1 and m_2 with key k1. m_1 is the official batch accepted, while m_2 is the second and double-signed batch
3. Evidence is submitted that A double-signed with both m_1 and m_2
4. In order to prove this, the handleEvidence function must verify:  `m_1 != m_2`

```go
	if bytes.Equal(batch.BatchId, fraudulentBatchID) {
		return fmt.Errorf("batch IDs are the same")
	}
```
5. `public_key(sig(m_2)) == public_key(sig(m-1))`
```go
        //public_key(sig(m_2))
	signatureAddr, err := k.recoverEthAddressFromSecp256k1Signature(fraudulentBatchID, evidence.Signature)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

        //public_key(sig(m-1))
	validatorEthAddr, err := k.getEthAddressForBatch(ctx, evidence.BatchNumber-1, evidence.OperatorAddress)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

        //public_key(sig(m_2)) == public_key(sig(m-1))
	if !bytes.Equal(validatorEthAddr, signatureAddr) {
		return fmt.Errorf("recovered address does not match validator entry. Recorded: %s, Got: %s", hex.EncodeToString(validatorEthAddr), hex.EncodeToString(signatureAddr))
	}

```
In order to bypass this check, alls a malicious validator needs to do is change their key on block n so that the check fails: `public_key(sig(m_2)) == public_key(sig(m-1))`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User is registered as a validator and commits a double-sign

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Validator signs batch m-1 (legitimate batch) with key k1 in block n-1
2. Validator changes key to k2
3. In block n, validator signs both batch m_1 (block n's legitimate batch) and m_2 (double-signed batch)
4. When evidence of double-signing is submitted, the validation logic checks:
i. Is batch m-1 different from batch m_2? Yes, they are different batches
ii. Does public_key(sig(m-1)) == public_key(sig(m_2))? No, since we changed our keys
5. The validator successfully evades slashing despite having committed a double-sign violation

### Impact

The integrity of the entire consensus system is compromised. Validators can double-sign batches with impunity, potentially leading to conflicting states being finalized. This undermines the safety guarantees of the blockchain and could lead to network forks. The economic security model collapses as validators face no penalties for malicious behavior, eliminating the financial disincentives that secure the network.


### Mitigation

Keep track of ALL the past keys of validators, when checking for a double-sign, check if there was a double-sign scenario involving ANY of the past keys
