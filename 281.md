# Unauthorized Fee Manipulation in `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees()`

**Summary**

The `SedaCoreV1::increaseFees()` function is intended to allow only the owner to increase the fees for a pending request. However, anyone can call this function and arbitrarily increase the fees for any request. This contradicts the functionâ€™s NatSpec `(@dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request)` and introduces a privilege escalation vulnerability.

```javascript
    /// @inheritdoc ISedaCore
    /// @dev Allows the owner to increase fees for a pending request
    function increaseFees(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 additionalRequestFee,
        uint256 additionalResultFee,
        uint256 additionalBatchFee
 >>   ) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused {          //@audit no access control
        // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
        if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
            revert InvalidFeeAmount();
        }

        RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
        if (details.timestamp == 0) {
            revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
        }

        details.requestFee += additionalRequestFee;
        details.resultFee += additionalResultFee;
        details.batchFee += additionalBatchFee;

        emit FeesIncreased(requestId, additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee);
    }

```

**Recommended Mitigation**

Restrict fee adjustments to only the request creator using an access control mechanism.

```javascript
 if (msg.sender != details.requestor) {   // Restrict access
        revert Unauthorized();
    }
```
