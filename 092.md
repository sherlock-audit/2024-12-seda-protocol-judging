# Mismatch Between User-Specified Index and Sorted Leaves

The function [GetProof](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/utils/merkle_proof.go#L13-L63) takes an index (referring to an entry in the original unsorted `entries` slice) and then proceeds to hash all entries and sort them before building the Merkle tree. Later, it computes the hash for the entry at the provided index (using the unsorted input) and searches the entire tree for a match. Because the leaves have been sorted, the position of the entry in the sorted list is not necessarily the same as the position in the original array.
  If the system using this utility depends on the Merkle proof for authenticating data (for example, for fund transfers or state transitions), an incorrect proof could lead to:
  - **Verification Failures:** Legitimate proofs might be rejected, causing a denial of service.
  - **Exploitation with Duplicates:** In cases where duplicate entries exist, the search will return the first matching leaf in the sorted order rather than the intended one. An attacker might exploit this discrepancy to provide a proof for an entry they should not have access to, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

## Root Cause:
The primary root cause is that the function accepts an index for the original (unsorted) list of entries, but then it sorts the entries before building the Merkle tree. This means that the index no longer correctly points to the intended entry in the sorted list, causing the wrong leaf (and thus an incorrect proof) to be generated.

1. **Original List vs. Sorted List:**  
   You pass in an index referring to the original list of entries:
   ```go
   entries := [][]byte{entryA, entryB, entryC}
   index := 1 // intending to use entryB
   ```
2. **Sorting the Leaves:**  
   The code hashes all entries and sorts them:
   ```go
   for i, entry := range entries {
       leaves[i] = leafHash(sha, entry)
   }
   sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
       return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
   })
   ```
   After sorting, the order of `leaves` might be `[hash(entryC), hash(entryA), hash(entryB)]`. The index `1` now points to `hash(entryA)` rather than `hash(entryB)`.

3. **Generating the Proof:**  
   The code then uses the index from the unsorted list to find the hash in the sorted tree, leading to a proof that doesnâ€™t match the originally intended entry.

### Code Snippet Highlighting the Issue

```go
// Original intended entry:
want := leafHash(sha, entries[index])  // @audit Here, index refers to unsorted entries.

// @audit-info But then the leaves are sorted:
sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
    return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
})

// The sorted order may change the position of `want` in the tree.
```
## Impact:
The primary impact of this issue is that it generates an incorrect Merkle proof for the intended entry because the provided index references the unsorted list while the proof is built from a sorted list, which misaligns the target entry. This miscalculation can lead to failed proof verifications or, in systems that rely on these proofs for security (such as those handling fund transfers or state updates), could potentially be exploited to bypass access controls or validation mechanisms, resulting in unauthorized actions or denial of service.

## Mitigation:
Sort the entries before calling `GetProof`, or adjust the index after sorting so that it matches the new order.
