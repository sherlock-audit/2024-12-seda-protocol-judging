# Protocol Deployer will break core result verification functionality for all users by initializing with non-contract prover address

### Summary

Missing validation on the prover address in the initializer will cause a complete failure of result verification for all users as the protocol deployer will accidentally initialize with an EOA or zero address instead of a valid prover contract. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L70-L79

### Root Cause

In SedaCoreV1.sol:initialize() there is no validation that sedaProverAddress is a contract address rather than an EOA or zero address.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Protocol deployer needs to call initialize() with an invalid prover address (EOA or address(0))
The contract must not have been previously initialized

### External Pre-conditions

None. The vulnerability does not depend on any external protocol states or conditions.

### Attack Path

Protocol deployer calls initialize() with an invalid prover address (accidental)
Contract is initialized successfully but with broken prover functionality
Users try to call postResult() which attempts to verify proofs via the invalid prover address
All proof verifications fail as the prover address cannot process contract calls
No results can be posted until a contract upgrade is performed

### Impact

All users cannot post results to the protocol. This completely breaks core protocol functionality until fixed via contract upgrade.

### PoC

function testExploit_EOAAsProver() public {
    // Initialize with EOA as prover
    sedaCore.initialize(eoa, 1 days);
    
    // Try to post a result
    bytes32 drId = bytes32(uint256(1));
    SedaDataTypes.Result memory result = SedaDataTypes.Result({
        drId: drId,
        blockTimestamp: block.timestamp + 1,
        gasUsed: 100000,
        paybackAddress: new bytes(0),
        data: new bytes(0)
    });
    
    bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](0);
    
    // This will fail since EOA can't process contract calls
    vm.expectRevert();
    sedaCore.postResult(result, 1, proof);
}

### Mitigation

Add contract existence check in initialize():
function initialize(address sedaProverAddress, uint256 initialTimeoutPeriod) external initializer {
    if(sedaProverAddress == address(0)) revert InvalidProverAddress();
    
    uint256 codeSize;
    assembly {
        codeSize := extcodesize(sedaProverAddress)
    }
    if(codeSize == 0) revert InvalidProverAddress();
    
    // Rest of initialization...
}
