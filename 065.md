# Commission withdrawals to fail silently.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/export.go#L83C2-L94C3

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/export.go#L83C2-L94C3

The issue occurs in the line _, _ = app.DistrKeeper.WithdrawValidatorCommission(ctx, valBz) where both return values from the WithdrawValidatorCommission function are deliberately ignored using the blank identifier _.
From the function signature, we can see WithdrawValidatorCommission returns two values:

Some amount/value 
An error value

By using _, _, the code is:

Discarding the withdrawn commission amount (which might be acceptable depending on the use case)
Crucially, ignoring any potential errors from the withdrawal operation.
The problem with this approach is that if the commission withdrawal fails for any reason (insufficient funds, distribution module issues, etc.), the code will continue execution as if nothing went wrong. This could result in a silently corrupted state where:

A validator's commission might remain in the distribution module when it should have been withdrawn
The exported genesis state would be inconsistent with the expected "clean slate" that the function is trying to create
Some validators will have their commissions properly withdrawn while others don't, creating an uneven playing field in the new chain.

### Mitigation

A proper fix would be to check the error returned by WithdrawValidatorCommission and handle it appropriately, similar to how other errors are handled in this function:

_, err = app.DistrKeeper.WithdrawValidatorCommission(ctx, valBz)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)  // Or handle the error in another appropriate way
}
