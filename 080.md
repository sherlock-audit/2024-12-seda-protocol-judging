# Executors will get underpaid while excessive gas will be refunded to the requestor

### Summary

Not accounting for outliers in execution gas usage may result in honest executors being underpaid, even if the gas limit is not exhausted, with the remaining amount refunded to the data requestor.

### Root Cause

In [`gas_meter.go:137`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L135-L144) a maximum gas that an executor can receive (`gasUsed`) is capped by the remainingExecGas divided by the replicationFactor:

```golang
func MeterExecutorGasUniform(executors []string, gasReport uint64, outliers []bool, replicationFactor uint16, gasMeter *types.GasMeter) {
	executorGasReport := gasMeter.CorrectExecGasReportWithProxyGas(gasReport)
@>	gasUsed := min(executorGasReport, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
	for i, executor := range executors {
		if outliers != nil && outliers[i] {
			continue
		}
		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForExecutor(executor, gasUsed)
	}
}
```

At the same time, gas consumption is not recorded for outliers. If the reported gas (`executorGasReport`) exceeds `gasMeter.RemainingExecGas() / uint64(replicationFactor)`, honest executors will be underpaid, even though `gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()` will not be zero after consumption is recorded.

Eventually, this unused residue will be refunded to the data requester instead of being paid to the executors.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Remaining exec gas is not enough to cover the expenses of ALL executors.
2. There are outliers among executors.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Consider the following scenario:

Remaining exec gas: `90,000`
Replication factor: `10`
Gas reported: `10,000` (uniform)
Outliers: `2`

The `gasUsed` will be calculated as `90,000 (remaining gas) / 10 (replication factor)` = `9,000`

Therefore, 8 honest executors will receive `9,000` gas each totaling to `72,000`.
Residue exec gas: `18,000` (will be refunded to data requestor).

Each validator is underpaid by `1,000` gas, even though there is enough remaining gas to fully compensate them and even refund `8,000` gas to the data requester.

### Impact

Executors are underpaid.

Please note that a similar conceptual mistake exists in the [`MeterExecutorGasDivergent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L155) function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reduce the replication factor by the number of outliers to achieve a fairer distribution:

```golang
func MeterExecutorGasUniform(executors []string, gasReport uint64, outliers []bool, replicationFactor uint16, gasMeter *types.GasMeter) {
	executorGasReport := gasMeter.CorrectExecGasReportWithProxyGas(gasReport)
---	gasUsed := min(executorGasReport, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
+++     gasUsed := min(executorGasReport, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor - len(outliers)))
	for i, executor := range executors {
		if outliers != nil && outliers[i] {
			continue
		}
		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForExecutor(executor, gasUsed)
	}
}
```
