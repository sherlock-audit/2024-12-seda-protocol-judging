# Proxy rewards are not calculated according to the whitepaper

### Summary

Currently, the implementation deviates from the whitepaper when it comes to the proxy rewards calculation.

### Root Cause

The problem is that the calculations for proxies are done incorrectly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

Miscalculated rewards.

### Impact

Proxies are underpaid as a result.

### PoC

Let's consider the proxies rewarding process:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/gas_meter.go#L87-95
```go

	// Compute the proxy gas used per executor, capping it at the max uint64
		// value and the remaining execution gas.
		gasUsedPerExecInt := proxyConfig.Fee.Amount.Quo(gasMeter.GasPrice())
		var gasUsedPerExec uint64
		if gasUsedPerExecInt.IsUint64() {
			gasUsedPerExec = min(gasUsedPerExecInt.Uint64(), gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
		} else {
			gasUsedPerExec = min(stdmath.MaxUint64, gasMeter.RemainingExecGas()/uint64(replicationFactor))
		}

		gasMeter.ConsumeExecGasForProxy(pubKey, proxyConfig.PayoutAddress, gasUsedPerExec, replicationFactor)
	}

```


It can be seen that the `gasUsedPerExecInt` is first calculated right but then the minimum taken from this value and the result of the division of `RemainingExecGas()` and the `replicationFactor` which is a deviation from the whitepaper formula. As a result, the error is not returned and some proxies are underpaid.

### Mitigation

Consider handling the case when there is an error returned if the amount paid is below the proxies' fees that are set in the proxy config and must be paid. Otherwise, proxies just do a job without even being paid
