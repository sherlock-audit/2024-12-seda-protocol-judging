# Race Conditions in Replication Factor Checks

## Summary
Data requests fail because of insufficient executors if staker count decrease after replication factor validation

## Vulnerability Detail

The check use the live staker count at the moment of request submission so If executors unstake or are removed after this check but before the request is processed, the actual staker count drop below the required replication factor.  

it shows that the executors can unstake or be removed from the allowlist reducing the STAKERS.len() after a data request pass the initial replication check but before it enter the commit/reveal phase.  
 
The stored data request retain the original replication factor even if the staker count drop below it later.  

**In summary :**
Staking Configuration: apply to future staking actions not existing stakes or unstakes.
```rust
// owner can adjust staking parameters (the minimum stake)
STAKING_CONFIG.save(deps.storage, &self)?;
```
Staking: so the users can stake tokens at any time increasing the STAKERS count in stake.rs
```rust
// Stake function allows users to add/update their stake
executor.tokens_staked += amount;
STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
```

Unstaking: The users can unstake tokens immediately after staking as no cooldown or lockup in the unstake.rs

```rust
// Unstake function allows users to reduce their stake
executor.tokens_staked -= self.amount;
executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal += self.amount;
STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
```
Allowlist Removal: Then the removed executors are excluded from future requests but can still unstake meaning that the removed executors cannot participate in new data requests but can still unstake in remove_from_allowlist.rs

```rust
// Owner can remove an executor from the allowlist
ALLOWLIST.remove(deps.storage, &public_key);
```
as it does not affect already validated requests or prevent unstaking as the removed executors cannot participate in new data requests but can still unstake.

Contract Pausing: stop all contract operations (staking, unstaking, data requests) as it cannot selectively block unstaking while allowing other operations.

**For example:**
Initial state: STAKERS.len() = 10.

Then user A stake -> STAKERS.len() = 11.

A data request with replication_factor = 10 is submitted and validated since 11 â‰¥ 10).
Then a user A unstake -> STAKERS.len() = 10.

and user B unstake -> STAKERS.len() = 9.

Result:

As the data request now require 10 executors but only 9 are available resulting to failure.

**Attack Scenario**

Stake:

A user stakes tokens to become an executor, increasing STAKERS.len().

Request Validation:

A data request is submitted and validated against the current STAKERS.len().

Unstake:

The same user immediately unstakes reducing STAKERS.len().
Result:

The data request now has an invalid replication factor (STAKERS.len() < replication_factor).

## Proof of Concept (PoC) 


1. **Initial State**  
   -there are 12 executors staked in the system.  
   - The protocol require a replication factor of 10 for data requests.

2. **Data Request Submission**  
   - A user then submit a data request with replication_factor = 10.  (post_request.rs)
     ```rust
    
     let stakers_length = STAKERS.len(deps.storage)?; 
     if self.posted_dr.replication_factor as u32 > stakers_length { 
     ```  
   - The request pass the validation and stored with the replication factor as 10.

3. **Staker Unstaking**  
   - Before the request enter the commit phase, The 5 executors unstake.(unstake.rs)  
     ```rust
     
     executor.tokens_staked -= self.amount; // reduce the staker count
     STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
     ```  
   - The staker count drop to 7 as (12 - 5).

4. **Data Request Processing**  
   - The contract try to process the request but since it  require 10 executors.(commit_results.rs)
     ```rust
     let dr = state::load_request(deps.storage, &dr_id)?;
     // so the dr.replication_factor = 10, but STAKERS.len() = 7
     if dr.replication_factor as u32 > STAKERS.len(deps.storage)? { // 10 > 7  will cause error
     ```  
   - The request fail with `DataRequestReplicationFactorTooHigh(7)`.

5. **Outcome**  
   - The data request cannot be fulfilled due to insufficient executors and the user lose gas fees, the request expire without any resolution.  

 
## Impact*
Legitimate request fail despite the initial validation.  
Users pay for requests that cannot be complete.   

## Recommendation 
1. Store the staker count at request submission and use it for all subsequent checks in the post_request.rs  
```rust

  let snapshot_stakers = STAKERS.len(deps.storage)?;
  // to store the snapshot_stakers with the data request 
```  
2. Prevent executors from unstaking while participating in active requests in the unstake.rs 
```rust
if executor.locked_until > env.block.time {
    return Err(ContractError::StakeLocked);
}
```
