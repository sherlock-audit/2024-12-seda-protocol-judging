# Malicious proposers can prevent batches from being posted to Prover contracts

### Summary

Posting a batch in the Prover contract requires [consensus](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L112-L123) based on the total voting power of the batch signers. However, a malicious proposer can prevent valid vote extensions (batch signatures) from being recorded.

### Root Cause

When calculating the [`powerPercent`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L185) of each validator in the Validator Tree, it is based on the [total power](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/endblock.go#L160) of the last active validator set.

```golang
func (k Keeper) ConstructValidatorTree(ctx sdk.Context) ([]types.ValidatorTreeEntry, []byte, error) {
  // @audit total power is the total power of the last active validator set
	totalPower, err := k.stakingKeeper.GetLastTotalPower(ctx)
  // ... snip ...
  
	err = k.stakingKeeper.IterateLastValidatorPowers(ctx, func(valAddr sdk.ValAddress, power int64) (stop bool) {
    // ... snip ...
		powerPercent := uint32(math.NewInt(power).MulRaw(1e8).Quo(totalPower).Uint64())
```

However, consensus for vote extensions is only based on the total submitted [extended votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L250-L256). Extended votes is injected by the proposer and a malicious proposer can set it arbitrarily.

```golang
func (h *Handlers) ProcessProposalHandler() sdk.ProcessProposalHandler {
	return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abcitypes.RequestProcessProposal) (*abcitypes.ResponseProcessProposal, error) {
		// ... snip ...

		var extendedVotes abcitypes.ExtendedCommitInfo
		if err := json.Unmarshal(req.Txs[0], &extendedVotes); err != nil {
			h.logger.Error("failed to decode injected extended votes tx", "err", err)
			return nil, err
		}

		// Validate vote extensions and batch signatures.
		err = baseapp.ValidateVoteExtensions(ctx, h.stakingKeeper, req.Height, ctx.ChainID(), extendedVotes)
```

The proposed block with the malicious extended votes payload will pass the proposal as long as:
1. There is at least 1 vote, so that [total voting power](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L138-L140) is not 0.
2. The has a [BlockIdFlag](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L87) of Commit.
3. There are valid vote extensions enough to satisfy the [consensus check](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L143-L148). For 1 valid vote, that vote should a valid vote extension.

As long as the conditions above are satisfied, the malicious proposer can submit only 1 valid vote extension so there will
not be enough batch signatures to post a batch.

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. A Malicious proposer injects [`extendedVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L250) with just 1 valid vote extension.
2. Validators will accept the proposal since it will pass the [`ValidateVoteExtensions()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L256) and the [`verifyBatchSignatures()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L264) check .
3. In the `PreBlocker()`, only the 1 vote extension will be recorded as a batch signature for its corresponding batch.
4. The batch can not be posted to the EVM Prover contracts because of the [consensus](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L123-L125) requirement.


### Impact

Malicious proposers can prevent valid batches from being posted.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider recording and getting the Total Voting Power of the active validator set from the height of the last local commit and use that for the consensus check.
