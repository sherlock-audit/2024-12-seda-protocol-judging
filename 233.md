# An attacker can block reveals of a data request so no valid result will be published.

### Summary

Posting a data result expects that the commitment hash [matches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/reveal_result.rs#L47-L49) the reveal hash. However, an attacker can insert an arbitrary commitment by front-running a `commit_result` call and reusing its proof to pass the [commit verification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L13).

### Root Cause

- In [reveal_result:47-49](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/reveal_result.rs#L47-L49), the executor's commitment is expected to match the valid reveal body.
```rust
if &reveal_body_hash != committed_dr_result {
    return Err(ContractError::RevealMismatch);
}
```
- In [commit_result.rs:69](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L69), the expected message hash for the signature is `hash(chain_id, contract_address, dr_height)`. The commitment is not included in the message hash.
This allows anyone to front-run a valid `commit_result` call and reuse the proof but with their own [commitment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L16-L17).
```rust
pub fn verify(&self, public_key: &[u8], chain_id: &str, contract_addr: &str, dr_height: u64) -> Result<()> {
    self.verify_inner(public_key, chain_id, contract_addr, dr_height)
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None

### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. An executor commits a result.
2. The attacker front-runs the executor `commit_result` call with their own `commit_result` and invalid commitment.
3. When the executor attempts to post the result by calling `reveal_result`, the commitment does not match the reveal body and the transaction reverts.
4. The attack can be repeated for every executor that attempts to commit-reveal the data request, effectively blocking consensus.


### Impact
Any data request with valid results can be blocked and no results will be revealed. [Gas used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/keeper/endblock.go#L242-L252) by the revealers will not be compensated.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider including the reveal hash (commitment) in the signed message hash in `reveal_result` and `commit_result`.
