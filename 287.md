# The contracts require a signer who signs a batch to be part of the previous signers but this will lead to a point where to required thresghold is unreachable


### Summary

It is required that a signer be part of the previous batch signer in order to be included in the current batch:

[Check for previous Signing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L112C12-L114C14)

```solidity
        if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
```
 Every time a validator fails to sign a batch or his voting power changes, that means he cannot sign any future batches anymore. This can continue overtime and a point will reach where even if all the eligible signers have signed, the threshhold cannot be reached hence new batches can not be included on the network hence a denial of service.

### Root Cause

- Requiring current batch signer to be part of the current batch

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Being part of previous batch signers

### External Pre-conditions

- Validator failing to sign a single batch

### Attack Path

- Initially we are having a validator set of 15 giving us a total Power of 100%
- They sign batches regularly
- But at some point these validators get issues like their nodes being down or not trusting the validity of data
- As time continues the number has reduced to 7, who only makeup 60% of the voting power.
- Those validators who failed to sign previous batches can no longer sign anymore and even though the 7 eligible validators sign they can not reach the threshold hence no new batches can be posted anymore

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Don't require signers to be part of the previous batch signers.
