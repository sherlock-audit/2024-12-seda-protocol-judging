# Sensitive on-chain data found for endblock.go will expose wallet private keys to account take-over

### Summary

Private keys have been found along with their public keys in the test file pertaining to `endblock.go`. They are on lines 573 to 675 of `endblock_test.go` and relate to the following lines of code in `endblock.go` within the root cause. "All active validators must have a registered Proving Public Key for batch signing. This requirement only applies once a proving scheme is activated, such as through a network upgrade proposal." (SEDA Chain).

### Root Cause

The link to the page that gives account takeover access to `endblock.go` via `endblock_test.go` is as follows. Also note the links as well to calling public keys in `endblock.go`.

### Impact

Access to private key wallets can lead to account-takeover. And loss of funds and assets.

The compromise of your private key can have severe consequences for your company. Here are ten potential impacts:

1. **Financial Loss**: Unauthorized access to your private key can lead to significant financial losses. In 2023, private key compromises resulted in approximately $880 million in losses across 47 incidents. citeturn0search4

2. **Operational Disruption**: An attacker with your private key can disrupt business operations by transferring or locking funds, deploying malicious contracts, or altering transaction records.

3. **Reputational Damage**: A security breach involving your private key can erode client and partner trust, leading to reputational harm and potential loss of business opportunities.

4. **Legal and Regulatory Consequences**: Unauthorized activities conducted using your private key can implicate your company in legal issues, resulting in fines, sanctions, or other regulatory actions.

5. **Data Breach**: Access to your private key may allow attackers to retrieve sensitive business information stored on the blockchain, leading to data breaches.

6. **Increased Security Costs**: Recovering from a private key compromise often requires significant investment in security measures, audits, and system overhauls to prevent future incidents.

7. **Client and Partner Loss**: Security breaches can lead to the loss of clients and partners who may seek more secure alternatives, impacting revenue and growth.

8. **Market Position Decline**: Continuous security issues can weaken your company's position in the market, making it less competitive.

9. **Intellectual Property Theft**: Attackers may access proprietary algorithms, smart contracts, or other intellectual property, leading to competitive disadvantages.

10. **Long-Term Trust Deficit**: Even after resolving the immediate issues, rebuilding trust with stakeholders can be a prolonged and challenging process.

Protecting your private key is essential to prevent these potential impacts and ensure the security and integrity of your company's operations. 

### PoC

The `endblock.go` contract exposes private keys via the `endblock_test.go` file at the following location. Bare in mind that `endblock.go` calls a lot of public key functions.

1. First visit the following link where you will find a plethora of private keys.
2. Then open something like meta-mask or other providers.
3. Import the private key as your account with no need for a mnemonic phrase.
4. You know have access to all accounts listed in the link below to `endblock.go` via `endblock_test.go`.

If an attacker gains access to your private key, they can effectively control your company wallet, leading to a complete account takeover. Here's how they might exploit this access:

1. **Unauthorized Transactions**: The attacker can initiate unauthorized transfers, siphoning funds to their own accounts without your consent.

2. **Smart Contract Deployment**: They could deploy malicious smart contracts from your wallet, potentially locking your funds or executing unintended operations.

3. **Token Manipulation**: The attacker might mint or burn tokens if your wallet has such privileges, disrupting your token economy.

4. **Changing Security Settings**: They can alter security configurations, such as removing multi-signature requirements, to facilitate future unauthorized access.

5. **Data Extraction**: Access to your wallet may allow them to retrieve sensitive business information stored on the blockchain.

6. **Phishing Campaigns**: Using your wallet's identity, they could launch phishing attacks against your partners or clients, damaging your reputation.

7. **Service Disruption**: They might interact with your services in a way that causes operational disruptions, leading to potential financial losses.

8. **Regulatory Violations**: By conducting illicit activities through your wallet, the attacker could implicate your company in legal issues.

9. **Credential Compromise**: They could use the access to your wallet to compromise other linked accounts or services.

10. **Persistent Access**: The attacker might establish backdoors or additional keys, ensuring continued access even if you attempt to secure your wallet.

Protecting your private key is paramount, as its compromise can lead to severe financial and reputational damage. 

### Mitigation

1. **Identify Exposed Keys**: Use GitHub code search, TruffleHog, GitGuardian, or Gitleaks to locate secrets in commit history.  
2. **Revoke Immediately**: Invalidate compromised keys (API, SSH, AWS) to cut off unauthorized use.  
3. **Notify Stakeholders**: Alert team members or security leads to coordinate mitigation steps.  
4. **Remove File in New Commit**: Quickly delete the file from the repo to reduce exposure (though history rewrite is still needed).  
5. **Make Repo Private (Temporarily)**: Restrict access until history is cleaned if the repo is public.  
6. **Assess Damage**: Check logs to see if the key was used maliciously; take extra steps if abuse was found.  
7. **Filter Repo History**: Use `git filter-repo` or `git filter-branch` to remove files or strings from commits.  
8. **BFG Repo-Cleaner**: Simplify secret removal by deleting or replacing strings in bulk.  
9. **Force-Push Cleaned History**: Overwrite GitHub’s remote with the sanitized commit history.  
10. **Disable Branch Protections**: Temporarily turn off branch protection rules to allow force-pushing.  
11. **Remove Old References**: Run `git reflog expire` and `git gc --prune=now --aggressive` to purge old commits locally.  
12. **Notify Collaborators**: They must re-clone the repo; old clones still contain the secret.  
13. **Check Forks**: If others have forked the repo, have them delete or clean it to avoid reintroducing the secret.  
14. **GitHub Cleanup**: GitHub may hold orphaned commits in caches—contact Support if needed.  
15. **Add to `.gitignore`**: Prevent future commits of private keys or `.env` files.  
16. **Use Environment Variables**: Don’t hardcode credentials; load them from secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).  
17. **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Implement tools like git-secrets, Gitleaks, or GitGuardian in CI/CD to block new leaks.  
18. **Enable Secret Scanning**: Turn on GitHub’s Secret Scanning & Push Protection for real-time detection.  
19. **Continuous Monitoring**: Schedule scans or use continuous scanning services to detect new secrets quickly.  
20. **Post-Mortem**: Learn from the mistake; improve training, processes, and enforce security measures to avoid repeats.
