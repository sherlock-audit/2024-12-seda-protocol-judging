# ECDSA Signature Malleability in Batch Verification

### Summary

Lack of ECDSA signature canonicalization will cause a signature malleability vulnerability for the Seda Protocol as malicious actors will be able to generate multiple valid signatures for the same batch, potentially enabling replay attacks and causing consensus issues.


### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L383, the `verifyBatchSignatures`  the `crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65])` call does not enforce canonical (low-S) signatures. The Ethereum library `Ecrecover` itself recovers public keys from both low-S and high-S signatures, enabling signature malleability.

### Attack Path



- A validator signs a batch with signature (r, s, v)
- An attacker observes the original signature
- Attacker computes an alternate signature (r, n-s mod n, v') by negating the s-value
- Both signatures verify successfully since they recover to the same validator address
- Attacker leverages this to:

1. Submit duplicate batch signatures that appear different but verify to the same validator leading to slashing
2. Create inconsistencies between nodes that may accept different signature variants and cause consensus failures


### Impact

The protocol suffers from a security vulnerability that undermines the uniqueness property of signatures. This vulnerability could lead to:

- Inconsistent batch verification across different nodes leading to consensus issues
-  Malicious double-signing and slashing
