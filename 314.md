# SEDA is utilizing CometBFT version v0.38.15, which is affected by two critical security issues identified in the CometBFT security advisories.

### Summary

Seda is currently using CometBFT [v0.38.15](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-babylon/blob/main/babylon/go.mod#L8), which is vulnerable to two significant security issues:

[Network Stall Due to Malicious Block Parts](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-r3r4-g7hq-pq4f): A bug in CometBFT’s validation of block part indices allows a malicious peer to disseminate invalid block parts, potentially halting the network. This issue could severely impact validators and full nodes, as the network becomes unable to process valid data.

[Disrupted Syncing Process via Blocks:](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-22qq-3xwm-r5x4) A malicious peer can disrupt a node’s ability to sync by reporting an incorrect block height, causing the syncing process to fail indefinitely. This issue affects full nodes, which become stuck in a continuous sync attempt to a non-existent height.

### Root Cause

In the CometBFT validation code, the absence of validation between Part.Index and Part.Proof.Index allows a malicious peer to propagate invalid block parts.

In the blocksync protocol, the failure to handle cases where the latest block height decreases causes syncing issues.

### Internal Pre-conditions

corrupt version being used

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The validators and full nodes suffer from a network halt when a malicious peer disseminates invalid block parts. The attacker gains the ability to stall the network by sending incorrect block data.

The full nodes suffer from sync failures when a malicious peer reports incorrect block heights. The attacker disrupts the node's ability to sync by reporting decreasing block heights, causing a node to attempt synchronization indefinitely with an invalid height.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Upgrade to CometBFT v0.38.17 to resolve both issues.
