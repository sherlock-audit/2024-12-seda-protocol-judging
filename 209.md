# `postBatch` lacks duplicate vote checks, allowing reuse of validator proofs and signatures

### Summary
The `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch` function iterates over arrays of validator proofs and signatures. For each proof, it verifies that the validator is included in the latest `validatorsRoot` and that the signature is valid for the corresponding `batchId`. It then aggregates the validators’ voting power, and if the total reaches the required consensus threshold (66.6%), the batch is accepted. However, the function does not check whether a validator’s vote has already been counted for a particular batchId, allowing the same validator’s proof and signature to appear multiple times. **This flaw can entirely break the system.**

### Root Cause
In the `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch` function, the following code iterates over validator proofs without checking for duplicate votes:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L110-L120
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
            // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
            // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
            //@audit add the voting power to votingPower variable
            votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
        }
```
The loop simply verifies the validity of each proof and signature, then adds the associated voting power to the `votingPower` variable. There is no mechanism to ensure that a validator’s vote is counted only once for a given `batchId`. This omission allows an attacker to include the same validator’s proof and signature multiple times. As a result, even a validator with minimal voting power can be artificially amplified to exceed the consensus threshold:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L123-L125
```solidity
        // Check that voting power meets or exceeds the consensus threshold (2/3)
        if (votingPower < CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE) {
            revert ConsensusNotReached();
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
- Contract not being in `paused` state

### External Pre-conditions
n/a

### Attack Path
There are enormous ways this issue can be exploited, however i have included some of them here:
**Attack 1 – Permanently Disable `Secp256k1ProverV1`:**
- The attacker becomes a validator with 1% voting power when the SEDA chain transitions to a permissioned validators phase.
- The attacker signs an arbitrary `batchId`.
- The attacker calls `postBatch` with `newBatch.height` set to uint64.max, and supplies arrays (`signatures` and `validatorsProof`) that each include 67 copies of the same signature/proof.
- The attacker submits the batch on the `Secp256k1ProverV1`.
- All validator proof and signature checks pass, and the cumulative `votingPower` becomes 67%, which exceeds the `CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE`.
- The new batch height is set to the maximum possible (uint64.max), preventing any new batches from ever being submitted.

**Attack 2 – Steal All Batch Sender Fees from Pending Requests:**
- Assume there are 100 pending requests with a total batch fee of `10 ETH`.
- The attacker becomes a validator with 1% voting power when the SEDA chain transitions to the permissioned validators phase.
- The attacker signs an arbitrary `batchId` where its `resultsRoot` is the Merkle root of all 1000 requests.
- The attacker calls `postBatch` with arrays (signatures and validatorsProof) each containing 67 identical entries.
- The attacker submits the batch on the `Secp256k1ProverV1`.
- All validator proof and signature checks pass, and the cumulative votingPower reaches 67%, surpassing the consensus threshold.
- The attacker then repeatedly calls postResult on the SedaCoreV1 contract with results corresponding to the pending requests.
- As a result, all batch sender fees are transferred to the malicious validator.

### Impact
Some of impacts...
- A single malicious validator can permanently disable the `Secp256k1ProverV1` by signing a batch with a height of `uint64.max`.
- A single malicious validator can submit an arbitrary batch with a manipulated `resultsRoot` to steal all the batch sender fees.
- A single malicious validator can submit an arbitrary batch to set fraudulent results for requests.
- If a batch has not met the consensus threshold, a malicious actor can include duplicate validator entries to bypass the threshold requirement.

### PoC

### Mitigation
A single validator must not be able to vote more than once for the same batch. One possible fix (though it might not be the most gas-optimized solution) is as follows:
```solidity
        mapping(address=>mapping(bytes32=>bool)) public votedForBatch;
        //...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
            if(votedForBatch[validatorsProofs[i].signer][batchId]) revert CantVoteTwice();
            // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
            // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
            votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
            votedForBatch[validatorsProofs[i].signer][batchId] = true;
        }
       //...
```
