# Honest executors will be forced to pay gas for if their commitments arrive after the reveal stage has started

### Summary

A logical flaw in the commitment verification process will cause an economic disadvantage for a subset of executors in the protocol as executors who commit after the reveal phase has already begun will be forced to pay gas unnecessarily, creating an unfair penalty for validators who commit valid data but are simply later in the sequence than others.


### Root Cause

The protocol design allows for executors to continue submitting commitment transactions after the minimum replication factor has been reached, but then forces these late-committing executors to pay gas fees despite their commitments being valid contributions to the network. This occurs because the verification process in the CanExecutorCommit calls verify_commit which fails verification once the reveal phase has started, even though commits should still be valid at this point.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/query.rs#L13-L31

```rust
pub fn verify_commit() {

    // error if reveal stage has started (replication factor reached)
    if dr.reveal_started() {
        return Err(ContractError::RevealStarted);
    }
```

When the replication factor threshold is reached (e.g., 80 commits in a scenario with replication factor 80), the protocol transitions to the reveal phase. However, additional committers beyond this threshold (e.g., executors 81-100) have their CanExecutorCommitQuery fail due to the verify_commit function returning false, solely because the system has entered the reveal phase. As a result, these late-committing executors are incorrectly forced to pay gas for their commitment transactions.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The replication factor for data requests must be set to a value lower than the total number of available executors (e.g., replication factor 80 with 100 executors available)
2. A data request must be submitted and processed with many executors attempting to commit in close succession
3. The system must transition from the commit phase to the reveal phase once the replication factor threshold is met

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A data request is posted with a replication factor of N (e.g., 80)
2. Multiple executors (more than N) attempt to commit to the data request, racing to process it
3. The first N executors successfully commit, meeting the replication factor and triggering the transition to the reveal phase
4. Additional executors beyond the first N submit commit transactions slightly later but still within a valid timeframe
5. These late-committing executors have their CanExecutorCommitQuery fail during verification due to the reveal phase having started
6. The late-committing executors are forced to pay gas for their transactions despite their commitments being valid and potentially useful contributions
7. This can be weaponized by proposers by ordering transactions to make certain executors pay fees

### Impact

The protocol's security model suffers from an economic fairness issue. Executors who are slightly slower to commit (executors 81-100 in our example) are unfairly penalized with gas costs, despite submitting valid commitments that would strengthen the protocol's security. This creates a disincentive for executors to participate if they believe they might not be among the first N to commit. Similarly, executors might be incentivized to bribe certain validators to ensure their transactions always make it before the replication factor which breaks the following expectations for the protocol:
> Gas Allocation and Fee Payments: The gas allocation and fee distribution processes are inherently complex. Special attention should be given to potential edge cases that could impact fairness, efficiency, or execution reliability.

### Mitigation

Modify the commit verification logic to continue accepting valid commitments even after the replication factor has been reached
