# DoS Risk from Multiple Transfers with FeeDistributed event in `SedaCoreV1.sol`

### Summary

In the `SedaCoreV1.sol` multiple `_transferFee` calls (to `paybackAddress,` `msg.sender`, `batchSender`, and `requestor`) could be exploited by a malicious recipient rejecting transfers, causing the transaction to revert.

### Root Cause

Having a push-based transfer function throughout the `SedaCoreV1.sol` makes the contract vulnerable to a malicious smart contract rejecting the transfers. It's best practice to Implement a pull-based pattern.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Trying to transfer money to an attacker.
2. Trying to transfer money to a smart contract without a `receive()` or `fallback()` function.

### External Pre-conditions

1. If a smart contract doesn't have a `receive()` or `fallback()` function.
2. If the attacker is rejecting transfers to halt the protocol progress.


### Attack Path

1. The FeeDistributed event is emitted multiple times.
2. Attackers reject all of them constantly.


### Impact

Blocks result submission, halting protocol progress.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 Implement a pull-based pattern where recipients claim fees later
