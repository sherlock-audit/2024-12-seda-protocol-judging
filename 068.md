# lack of access control in postresult function can lead to stealing of other users funds

the postresult function handles fee distribution and manages refunds based on the results submitted but there is an issue in the function, this function lacks a check to make sure the msg.sender is equal to the original requestor, and has no restricted access, since anyone can call this function, a bad user can call this function with a result,drID of another user and collect the submiterfee and the resultfee since this fees will be sent to the caller of the function

### Root Cause

in the postresult function lack a check to ensure the caller is the original requestor(the owner of the result.id)

### Internal Pre-conditions

1:the attacker just need to set the payable address in the function to a vallid address to recieve the submitterfee
2:the resultfee will be sent to the attackers address, since the result fee is sent to the msg.sender

### External Pre-conditions

no accesss control

### Attack Path

an attacker just needs to call the function with other users resultid to steal the funds for that result

### Impact

a bad user can steal both the submitterfee and the resultfee since the function is not restricted to only the requestor

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

introduce access control to the function to restrict anyone from calling the function accept the original requestor(owner of the result.id)
