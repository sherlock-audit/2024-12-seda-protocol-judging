# Malicious attacker can impersonate executors and send commits on their behalf

### Summary

Commit `proof` is a replayable signature since the hash uses data request height as the only variable but it is not unique.

### Root Cause

During [commit verification](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L67-L70), the hash of the message to verify the signature consists of 3 parameters: chainID, core contract address, and data request height:

```rust
    // verify the proof
    let chain_id = CHAIN_ID.load(deps.storage)?;
    commit.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), dr.height)?;
```

The problem is `dr.height` is not unique and shares the same value ([`env.block.height`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L97-L97)) for all data requests posted in the same block:


```rust
        // save the data request
        let dr = DataRequest {
            id:                 hex_dr_id,
            version:            self.posted_dr.version,
            exec_program_id:    self.posted_dr.exec_program_id,
            exec_inputs:        self.posted_dr.exec_inputs,
            exec_gas_limit:     self.posted_dr.exec_gas_limit,
            tally_program_id:   self.posted_dr.tally_program_id,
            tally_inputs:       self.posted_dr.tally_inputs,
            tally_gas_limit:    self.posted_dr.tally_gas_limit,
            replication_factor: self.posted_dr.replication_factor,
            consensus_filter:   self.posted_dr.consensus_filter,
            gas_price:          self.posted_dr.gas_price,
            memo:               self.posted_dr.memo,

            payback_address: self.payback_address,
            seda_payload:    self.seda_payload,
            commits:         Default::default(),
            reveals:         Default::default(),

@>          height: env.block.height,
        };
```

This opens up an ability for the attacker, once the first commit is posted by the legitimate executor, to post commits for all other data requests created in the same block by using the same signature. This will lead to an inability of the executors to reveal those requests later and data requests will time out eventually.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. More than 1 request posted in the same block

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A legitimate executor posts the first commit request
2. An attacker observes a signature used and posts requests for all other data requests of the same (block) height
3. Executors fail to reveal
4. Requests time out

### Impact

1. Executors are not able to post reveal requests
2. Affected requests will time out since the replication factor cannot be reached.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use request ID instead of height for hashing.
