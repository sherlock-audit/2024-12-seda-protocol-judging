# A malicious user can block posting batches

### Summary

Anyone can call the `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch()` function to post batches and update critical batching variables and this can be used to block posting subsequent batches


### Root Cause

The problem is that due to insufficient input validation, a malicious user can call `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch()` to post a batch with an arbitrary `newBatch.validatorsRoot` (e.g `0x00`) and as such the next time the function is called to post a batch, it will revert

File: seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol
090:     function postBatch(
091:         SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
092:         bytes[] calldata signatures,
093:         SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
094:     ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
095:         Secp256k1ProverStorage storage s = _storageV1();
096:         // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
097:         if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
098:             revert InvalidBatchHeight();
099:         }
100:         // Each signature needs a validator Merkle Proof
101:         if (signatures.length != validatorProofs.length) {
102:             revert MismatchedSignaturesAndProofs();
103:         }
104: 
105:         bytes32 batchId = SedaDataTypes.deriveBatchId(newBatch);
106: 
107:         // Accumulate voting power from valid validators to ensure sufficient consensus
108:         // Each validator must prove membership and provide a valid signature
109:         uint64 votingPower = 0;
110:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
111:             // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
112:  @>         if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
113:                 revert InvalidValidatorProof();
114:             }
115:             // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
116:             if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
117:                 revert InvalidSignature();
118:             }
119:             votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
120:         }
121: 
122:         // Check that voting power meets or exceeds the consensus threshold (2/3)
123:         if (votingPower < CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE) {
124:             revert ConsensusNotReached();
125:         }
126: 
127:         // After consensus is reached, commit the new batch and update validator set
128:         // This establishes the new state for future batch validations
129:         s.lastBatchHeight = newBatch.batchHeight;
130:  @>     s.lastValidatorsRoot = newBatch.validatorsRoot; // @audit HIGH: halt the chain
131:         s.batches[newBatch.batchHeight] = BatchData({resultsRoot: newBatch.resultsRoot, sender: msg.sender});
132:         emit BatchPosted(newBatch.batchHeight, batchId, msg.sender);
133:     }

```

as seen above, on L112 the validators proof is checked againts the last `s.lastValidatorsRoot` which is set at the time the batch was posted, if at the time the last bacth was posted an wrong value was used, then `postBatc()` will be entirely blocked

This is very serious issue because votes can only be extented for batches posted for prior blocks and if there are no batches for a number of rounds to extend votes for let alone to propose a block for for then the chain will halt

```go
File: seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go
75: func (h *Handlers) ExtendVoteHandler() sdk.ExtendVoteHandler {
76: 	return func(ctx sdk.Context, _ *abcitypes.RequestExtendVote) (*abcitypes.ResponseExtendVote, error) {
77: 		h.logger.Debug("start extend vote handler", "height", ctx.BlockHeight())
78: 
79: 		// Check if there is a batch to sign at this block height.
80: 	@>	batch, err := h.batchingKeeper.GetBatchForHeight(ctx, ctx.BlockHeight()+BlockOffsetSignPhase)

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Anyone can post a batch with invalid `newBatch.validatorsRoot`

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- At block 100 Alice post a batch with invalid `newBatch.validatorsRoot` e.g `0x00`
- current block is processed with batch from block 98
- at block 102 alice batch is used to process block 
- no valid batch can be signed from block 101 and above because `postBatch()` will revert on L112 and this can lead to a chain halt

### Impact

This can be used to block posting batches (DoS `Secp256k1ProverV1::postBatch()`) and possibly lead to a chain halt as batches cannot be posted and votes cannot be extended further the batch that was used to perform the attack

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider 
- implementing rigorous checks to ensure the `newBatch.validatorsRoot` is properly validated and
- prevent random users from posting batches as they have nothing to loose if they halt the chain except gas fees used for the transaction
