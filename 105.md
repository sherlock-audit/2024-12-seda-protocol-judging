# Batch Height Control Vulnerability in the Secp256k1Prover Contract

### Summary

The `Secp256k1Prover` contract relies on external actors to correctly increment the `batchHeight` when posting new batches. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability if an actor successfully posts a batch with the maximum possible `batchHeight` value (`uint64.max`). Since the contract only checks that the `batchHeight` is strictly greater than the last posted `batchHeight`, an actor can maliciously submit this maximum value, effectively preventing any future batch submissions and causing the system to become inoperable. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the design of the `batchHeight` management. The contract expects the solver to increment the `batchHeight` correctly, but it does not internally track or enforce the next valid `batchHeight`. This opens the door for actors to submit a batch with `batchHeight == uint64.max`, which would satisfy the check that the new batch must have a strictly higher `batchHeight` than the last one.

Once this maximum value is reached, the contract cannot accept any further batches, resulting in a DoS situation. 

The lack of contract-side control over the `batchHeight` enables the attacker to effectively lock the system by posting a batch with the maximum possible value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Actor Control Over Batch Height:** The contract allows the actor to choose and submit the `batchHeight` for new batches, as long as it is greater than the last posted batch height. An actor can choose `batchHeight == uint64.max`, as long as the previous `batchHeight` is less than this value.

2. **Batch Data Integrity:** The contract expects the batch data (including signatures and validator proofs) to be valid. As long as these conditions are met, the actor can submit a batch with a `batchHeight` of any valid value, including the maximum.

### Attack Path

1. **Actor Posts Maximum Batch Height:** The actor can submit a batch with `batchHeight == uint64.max` if the current `lastBatchHeight` is less than this value. This would pass the contract’s validation that the new batch’s height is strictly greater than the last batch’s height.

2. **Denial of Service:** Once the `batchHeight` reaches `uint64.max`, no further batches can be processed, as the contract will not accept a batch with a `batchHeight` less than `uint64.max`. This effectively locks the system, rendering it inoperable for new batch submissions.



### Impact

 **Denial of Service (DoS):** Once an attacker successfully posts a batch with `batchHeight == uint64.max`, the contract can no longer process any further batches. This essentially locks the system and prevents any new batches from being submitted, halting the entire batch processing mechanism. As a result, the functionality of the Secp256k1Prover contract is completely disrupted, rendering it inoperable.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Internal `batchHeight` Management:** The contract should internally track and increment the `batchHeight`. 

**Example**

```solidity
if (newBatch.batchHeight != s.lastBatchHeight + 1) {
    revert InvalidBatchHeight();
}
```
