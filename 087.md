# `ExtendVoteHandler`:: signing precedes the signer reload, potentially producing invalid signatures if the validator’s public key has changed

A potential issue arises in the sequence of signing and reloading the signer. The [Sign](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L75-L133) function is called before `ReloadIfMismatch`. If the validator’s public key in the `pubKeyKeeper` has been updated since the signer was last loaded, the signature is generated using an outdated private key. Only after signing does `ReloadIfMismatch` check and reload the signer if the public key has changed, but the signature has already been produced and is returned without re-signing.

```go
// ExtendVoteHandler handles the ExtendVote ABCI to inject a signature
// of the batch at the expected height if one exists.
func (h *Handlers) ExtendVoteHandler() sdk.ExtendVoteHandler {
    return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abcitypes.RequestExtendVote) (*abcitypes.ResponseExtendVote, error) {
        batch, err := h.batchingKeeper.GetBatchForHeight(ctx, ctx.BlockHeight()+BlockOffsetSignPhase)
        if err != nil {
            if errors.Is(err, collections.ErrNotFound) {
                return &abcitypes.ResponseExtendVote{VoteExtension: []byte{}}, nil
            }
            return nil, err
        }

        valKeys, err := h.pubKeyKeeper.GetValidatorKeys(ctx, h.signer.GetValAddress().String())
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        // Sign and reload the signer if the public key has changed.
        signature, err := h.signer.Sign(batch.BatchId, utils.SEDAKeyIndexSecp256k1)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
        err = h.signer.ReloadIfMismatch(valKeys.IndexedPubKeys)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        return &abcitypes.ResponseExtendVote{VoteExtension: signature}, nil
    }
}
```
## Impact Analysis
- In the [ProcessProposalHandler](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L235) (at the next block height), the signature is verified using [verifyBatchSignatures](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L264), which retrieves the current public key from either the `pubKeyKeeper` (for the first batch) or the validator tree (for subsequent batches). If the signature was made with an old key, it won’t match the current public key, causing validation to fail.
 - If a validator’s signature is invalid, their vote extension is rejected. If enough validators experience this issue (e.g., due to simultaneous key updates), the number of valid signatures for a batch might fall below a required threshold, preventing the batch from being processed.
- Batches in SEDA-chain likely aggregate transactions, including fund transfers or staking operations. Repeated failure to process batches could delay or halt these operations, disrupting service. While this doesn’t directly cause fund loss or unauthorized access, it significantly impacts availability, which is critical for the chain’s operation.
## Conditions for Exploitation
For this vulnerability to manifest:
- A validator’s public key must change after the signer is loaded but before `ExtendVoteHandler` runs.
- The validator must not reload the signer correctly beforehand, relying on the in-handler reload.
- The batch processing logic must require a minimum number of valid signatures, which could be unmet due to multiple validators hitting this issue.
The SEDASigner’s reload logic is designed to mitigate key mismatches, but doing so post-signing creates a window of inconsistency.

## Mitigation
Modify `ExtendVoteHandler` to call `ReloadIfMismatch` before Sign. If the keys mismatch, reload the signer and then generate the signature with the updated key. Also, ensure validators reload their signer before the voting phase, reducing reliance on in-handler checks.
