# Attacker Can Manipulate Gas Accounting to Execute Arbitrary WASM Code Without Limits

### Summary

Improper gas accounting in the WASM execution environment will cause an arbitrary code execution vulnerability for the blockchain network as an attacker will bypass gas limits by manipulating metering points and executing unrestricted WASM code.

### Root Cause

In [internal_run_vm](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/runtime/core/src/runtime.rs#L19), there is a missing enforcement of gas limits when setting `remaining_points` in the Wasmer instance. Specifically, when calculating the gas cost for argument processing and startup overhead, the function checks if `gas_cost < gas_limit`, but it does not properly enforce a strict gas limit boundary. If an attacker supplies a specially crafted `VmCallData `with manipulated gas constraints, they may be able to execute operations that exceed the intended gas limit. This could allow the execution of computationally expensive functions without proper restrictions, leading to resource exhaustion, denial of service, or arbitrary code execution within the WASM runtime environment. Additionally, since the error handling does not explicitly terminate execution when gas is exhausted (instead merely setting the exit code to 250), an attacker might be able to exploit this behaviour to continue execution beyond the intended constraints.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Attacker needs to submit** `VmCallData` with a manipulated `gas_limit` to set `remaining_points` to be **greater than the intended execution limit**.  
2. **Attacker needs to supply** an input payload where `args_bytes_total` is **large enough** to bypass the intended gas constraints due to improper enforcement in gas deduction.  
3. **WASM instance needs to initialize successfully** with `wasi_env` and `wasmer_instance`, allowing execution to proceed without immediate failure.  
4. **The execution result must not exceed** `MAX_VM_RESULT_SIZE_BYTES (96000 bytes)`, or the attack would be blocked due to result size enforcement.  
5. **Gas metering function must return** `MeteringPoints::Remaining(remaining_gas)`, allowing execution to continue even if it should have been exhausted.  
6. **Attacker needs to trigger** `internal_run_vm` with a WASM module that contains computationally expensive logic to exploit the gas miscalculation.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Gas price needs to be relatively low**, allowing the attacker to repeatedly execute the exploit without high costs.  
2. **The blockchain network must not have congestion**, ensuring the attacker’s transaction is processed without delays.  
3. **The WASM contract must be deployed and accessible**, meaning it has not been paused or upgraded to a patched version.  
4. **No external monitoring or rate-limiting mechanisms must be in place**, preventing detection and mitigation before significant exploitation occurs.  
5. **Any external price oracles used for gas calculations must remain stable**, ensuring that gas-related constraints are not dynamically adjusted to counteract the attack.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker deploys a malicious WASM contract** that manipulates execution results or gas metering.  
2. **Attacker calls `start_runtime()`** with carefully crafted `VmCallData` that triggers execution of their malicious WASM contract.  
3. **The function `internal_run_vm()` initializes the WASM execution environment** without proper sandboxing or validation of the contract’s behavior.  
4. **The malicious contract exploits improper gas metering (`set_remaining_points()`)** to misreport gas usage, allowing execution to continue indefinitely or consume excessive resources.  
5. **The attacker repeatedly executes the exploit**, draining available gas or causing a denial-of-service condition in the VM runtime.  
6. **If the execution result exceeds `MAX_VM_RESULT_SIZE_BYTES`, it triggers an unhandled error**, which could lead to execution failure or memory corruption.  
7. **The attacker can repeatedly invoke the exploit** to either crash the runtime, drain gas from legitimate users, or manipulate execution results for financial gain.

### Impact

The **protocol** suffers a **denial-of-service (DoS) attack**, preventing legitimate users from executing WASM contracts. The **attacker** gains **unlimited execution time** or **manipulated gas consumption**, potentially leading to **resource exhaustion** and **runtime instability**. If exploited repeatedly, the **protocol may crash**, affecting all users and **disrupting smart contract execution**.
