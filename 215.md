# Gas Meter can spend more gas than specified by the ExecGasLimit

### Summary
Users specify a gas limit to be used to complete their request with the respective gas. But the way gas is consumed/supplied can allow more gas to be distributed than supplied.

### Root Cause
Poor implementation of `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go/ConsumeExecGasForExecutor`

### Internal Pre-conditions
Limited gas limit was provided than required

### Vulnerabity Details
`x/tally/types/gas_meter.go/ConsumeExecGasForExecutor` or `x/tally/types/gas_meter.go/ConsumeExecGasForProxy` are called to allocate a specific amount of gas to excutor or proxy.

The fuction appends the `ExecutorGasUsed` or `ProxyGasUsed` structs to the `keeper.Excutors` or `keeper.Proxies` arrays where this amount will be used to calculate the amount that will be paid the excutor or proxy from the requester's escrow.

But an issue arises if the remaining gas for executor is less than the `amount` variable specified in the function params. This amount will be added to the excutors yet the addition of this amount will exceed the provided gas limit.

[For Executors](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L127C2-L138C2):
```go
    g.Executors = append(g.Executors, ExecutorGasUsed{
		PublicKey: executorPubKey,
		Amount:    math.NewIntFromUint64(amount),
	})
	//@audit since amount is greater than executor gas limit means, adding the above amount to the array will lead
    //distribution of more gas than specified by the user.
	if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}
```
[For proxies](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/tally/types/gas_meter.go#L105C2-L120C14):

```go
g.Proxies = append(g.Proxies, ProxyGasUsed{
		PayoutAddress: payoutAddr,
		PublicKey:     proxyPubkey,
		Amount:        math.NewIntFromUint64(amount),
	})

	if amount > g.execGasRemaining {
		g.execGasRemaining = 0
		return true
	}

```
### Impact
This will lead to a user spending more payment token amount from their escrow account since this exceeding gaslimit leads to more tokens being distributed hence a loss of funds. For cases where li

### PoC

User has a remaingGas of `4` and the amount sent to the consume function is `20`, the excutor receives the `20`. When you subtract the `20` from the `4` you get `16` exceeding gas units. Let assume a user specified a gasPrice of `6e16`, The user will pay more `19e16` payment tokens than intended for executor gas.

### Mitigation
Before saving the `amount` in the `excutors` array consider checking and only append the remaining remaining amount.
