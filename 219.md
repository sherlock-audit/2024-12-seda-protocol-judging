# Anybody can perforrm an unstake/withdrawal tx as the sender is not properly checked

### Summary

Anybody can perform an unstake/withdrawal tx for a different staker as the sender address is not properly verified.

### Root Cause

Sender is not verified from the provided message info.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker calls `execute()` for unstake/withdraw operation.

### Attack Path

An attacker calls `execute()` for unstake/withdraw operation on behalf of a different pubkey.

### Impact

Loss of funds for stakers.

### PoC

Consider how the unstake/withdraw functionality is currently implemented:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/unstake.rs#L11-13
```rust
      let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
        let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
        self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;
```

As you can see here, there is no check for the actual sender address and it only verifies the pubkey and then performs a withdraw to a sender:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/withdraw.rs#L36-39
```rust
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };
```


### Mitigation

Add a check for the sender from the message info similar to how it's done when setting a staking config:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/staking/execute/set_staking_config.rs#L9-11
```rust

      if info.sender != OWNER.load(deps.storage)? {
            return Err(ContractError::NotOwner);
        }
```

But instead of the owner, it has to be done with the executor address that corresponds to a pubkey.
