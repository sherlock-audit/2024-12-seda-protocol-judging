# Malicious attacker can force inflate voting power calculation

### Summary

The missing check for duplicate signatures during voting power calculation in `Secp256k1ProverV1.sol` makes it prone to manipulations and can get batches that lack 66% of consensus force posted and accepted.

### Root Cause

In `Secp256k1ProverV1.sol` `postBatch()` method, voting power is [calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L107-L120) as a sum of voting power of all validators that signed the batch:

```solidity
        // Accumulate voting power from valid validators to ensure sufficient consensus
        // Each validator must prove membership and provide a valid signature
        uint64 votingPower = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < validatorProofs.length; i++) {
            // Verify validator is part of the current validator set using Merkle proof
            if (!_verifyValidatorProof(validatorProofs[i], s.lastValidatorsRoot)) {
                revert InvalidValidatorProof();
            }
            // Verify signature is valid and signed by the validator
            if (!_verifySignature(batchId, signatures[i], validatorProofs[i].signer)) {
                revert InvalidSignature();
            }
            votingPower += validatorProofs[i].votingPower;
        }
```

Then this is used to ensure consensus is reached:

```solidity
        // Check that voting power meets or exceeds the consensus threshold (2/3)
        if (votingPower < CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE) {
            revert ConsensusNotReached();
        }
```

However, there is no check to ensure that `validatorProofs` and `signatures` contain unique values making them prone to manipulation by inflating arrays with duplicate items that will result in an inflated `votingPower` value.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Malicious user sees that a batch does not reach consensus (66%) thus reverts.
2. Malicious user alters the transaction by including duplicate signatures into `validatorProofs` and `signatures` input parameters to make it pass a consensus threshold check and posts it
3. Transaction is getting accepted

Another but more impactful attack path could be that malicious validator posts fabricated batches using its signature, which is repeated multiple times to reach consensus. This will allow it to post fabricated data results using that batch ID.

### Impact

This vulnerability renders the consensus threshold check useless exposing the contract to potentially invalid or fabricated results that may have catastrophic consequences (i.e. forged price feed response, etc).

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Ensure signatures and proofs do not have duplicates.
