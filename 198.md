# Attackers can permanently block batch submissions through batch height discontinuity

### Summary

A flaw in the batch submission verification mechanism can cause certain batches to be permanently lost by skipping batches when submitting to `postBatch`

### Root Cause

In `Secp256k1ProverV1.sol` the batch height validation only enforces that new batch heights must be greater than the last recorded batch height:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L90
```solidity
    function postBatch(
        SedaDataTypes.Batch calldata newBatch,
        bytes[] calldata signatures,
        SedaDataTypes.ValidatorProof[] calldata validatorProofs
    ) external override(ProverBase) whenNotPaused {
        Secp256k1ProverStorage storage s = _storageV1();
        // Prevents replay attacks via strictly ordered batches
        if (newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight) {
            revert InvalidBatchHeight();
        }
```
The code enforces "strictly ordered batches" which is an error as batches should be strictly monotonically increasing instead of just strictly increasing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Atleast 2 batches have completed and havent been submitted to `postBatch` yet

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes that the current last batch height that has been submitted to `postBatch` is n-1
2. Instead of submitting the next expected batch height n, the attacker submits batch n+1 to postBatch along with valid signatures and proofs
3. The validation passes since n+1 > n-1, satisfying the newBatch.batchHeight <= s.lastBatchHeight check
5. The batch is accepted and s.lastBatchHeight is updated to n+1
6. When another user attempts to submit a batch with height n, the transaction reverts because n < n+1, failing the batch height validation
7. Batch height n can never be submitted, creating a permanent gap in the batch sequence, leading to lost fees and DoS to key network functionality

### Impact

The integrity of the entire batching system is compromised. Once a batch height is skipped, it can never be submitted. A key network functionality is DoS'd leading to lost escrow fees and refunds for data request users, in addition to not receiving their expected data.


### Mitigation

Modify the batch height validation to enforce monotonic increases with no gaps
