# Disabling Vote Extensions can cause chain halts

### Summary

Disabling Vote Extensions will still cause the `PrepareProposal` and `ProcessProposal` handlers to [validate vote extensions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L192-L196). This validation, however, will fail because there will be [no consensus](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L143-L148) on the vote extensions.

### Root Cause

In both [PrepareProposalHandler()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L192-L196) and [ProcessProposalHandler()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L237-L259), it expects that Vote Extensions are enabled when the current height is 
greater than the `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight`, even if it is 0. It does not recognize that 0 means vote extensions are disabled in Cosmos-SDK.

```golang
// ref: PrepareProposalHandler()
  if req.Height > ctx.ConsensusParams().Abci.VoteExtensionsEnableHeight && collectSigs {
    err := baseapp.ValidateVoteExtensions(ctx, h.stakingKeeper, req.Height, ctx.ChainID(), req.LocalLastCommit)
    if err != nil {
      return nil, err
    }
```

The handlers then attempt to validate vote extensions, which will fail because there is [no consensus](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.11/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L143-L148) in vote extensions since total power in vote extensions is 0.

```golang
  // @audit sumVP below will be 0 since vote extensions are disabled and all votes will come with no vote extensions
	if requiredVP := ((totalVP * 2) / 3) + 1; sumVP < requiredVP {
		return fmt.Errorf(
			"insufficient cumulative voting power received to verify vote extensions; got: %d, expected: >=%d",
			sumVP, requiredVP,
		)
	}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to disable vote extensions by setting the consensus paramemter `VoteExtensionsEnabledHeight` to 0.
2. Batches already exist and current block height is at least 4.


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path
1. When the proposer prepares the proposal, it will always fail with an error due to [`ValidateVoteExtensions()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L193). No block will be proposed, and this will happen for every proposer, leading to a chain halt.


### Impact
Chain halt since every proposer will fail to propose a block. It will be impossible to disable VoteExtensions, which may become necessary for emergency/operational purposes.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider adding the condition that `VoteExtensionsEnableHeight` is not 0 before validating vote extensions in both PrepareProposalHandler() and ProcessProposalHandler().
