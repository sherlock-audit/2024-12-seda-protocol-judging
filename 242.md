# Any malicious validator can submit a vote extension with length < 65 bytes to crash validators

### Summary

Every validator verifies vote extensions and expects that a `voteExtension` has at least [65 bytes of data](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L383). Any malicious validator can exploit this assumption to trigger panics in every validator node that verifies their vote extension and cause a chain halt.

### Root Cause

In [`abci/handlers.go:383`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L383), the `voteExtension` slice is accessed from index 0 to 65 without first checking if the byte slice has at least 65 bytes.

```golang
sigPubKey, err := crypto.Ecrecover(batchID, voteExtension[:65])
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. A malicious validator modifies their `ExtendVoteHandler()` to submit a vote extension with length less than 65 bytes.
2. Multiple validators will verify this vote extension with [`VerifyVoteExtensionHandler()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L138-L173). This is where [`verifyBatchSignatures()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L159) is called and a panic is triggered.


### Impact

Every verifying validator will panic due to accessing an out-of-range index, which leads to a Chain Halt.


### PoC
None


### Mitigation

Consider adding a check for the length of the vote extension when `verifyingBatchSignatures()`. Ensure that it is at least 65 bytes.
