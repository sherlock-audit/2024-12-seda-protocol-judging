# A single validator can post a batch

### Summary

A single validator can post a batch bypassing the required voting power.

### Root Cause

In Secp256k1ProverV1.sol, validators can come together and post batches and when the total voting power of all the signatures provided is >= CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE the new batch is set as the current batch. The issue here is that there is no check for duplicate signatures, so one validator can pass his/her signature multiple times in the function argument up to the extent that the consensus will be reached and the batch will be posted.

This defeats the whole purpose of having a minimum consensus voting power

### Attack Path

Nil

### Impact

Batches can be posted by a single validator and this goes against the wole consensus of the system also adding that this batch can be malicious too as other validators won't vote on it

### PoC

Consensus is 50 votes. ALice is a validator she has 10 votes assigned to her she puts her signature 5 times and sends a batch along with the tx.

### Mitigation

Add a way to filter out duplicate signatures
