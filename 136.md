# `execute::commit_result::Execute` processes commit messages by parsing the provided public key and using it to check staking eligibility without validating that the transaction sender

In the `execute::commit_result::Execute` implementation, the contract processes commit messages by parsing the provided public key and using it to check staking eligibility without validating that the transaction sender (`_info.sender`) corresponds to this public key. For instance, [the code snippet below](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L55) shows the extraction of the public key solely from the commit message without any verification against the caller’s identity:  
```rust
let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(commit.public_key.as_str())?;
```
Similarly, [later in the logic](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/commit_result.rs#L17), the commitment is added based only on the public key provided in the commit message, as seen in:  
```rust
dr.commits.insert(self.public_key.clone(), commitment);
```
This omission means that any entity can supply someone else’s public key in their commit, allowing unauthorized commits. The verification step `commit.verify(...)` relies exclusively on the provided public key and does not enforce that the sender of the transaction is the owner of that key, leading to a critical authorization flaw.

## Root Cause
The root cause is the absence of a validation check that binds the caller’s identity (obtained from `_info.sender`) to the provided public key, allowing malicious actors to commit data using someone else’s credentials.

## Impact
An attacker can submit commits on behalf of legitimate stakers, potentially hijacking rewards or disrupting the intended operation of the staking and data request system.

## Mitigation
Implement a check to ensure that `_info.sender` corresponds to the provided public key before processing the commit.
