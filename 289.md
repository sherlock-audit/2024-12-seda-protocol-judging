# Missing onlyOwner modifier in function

### Summary

The missing onlyOwner modifier in the increaseFees function will cause a financial impact for the contract owner as any external actor will be able to increase fees for any pending request without authorization.

### Root Cause

In [SedaCoreV1.sol:206](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L206), the increaseFees function lacks the onlyOwner modifier. This allows any external address to call the function and increase fees for any pending request, bypassing the intended access control.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any external actor needs to call the increaseFees function with a valid requestId and arbitrary fee values (additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee).
2. The requestId must correspond to an existing request in the requestDetails mapping (i.e., details.timestamp != 0).
3. The caller must send ETH equal to the sum of the additional fees (msg.value == additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee).

### External Pre-conditions

1. The contract must not be paused (whenNotPaused modifier is enforced).
2. The external actor must have sufficient ETH to cover the additional fees.

### Attack Path

1. Any external actor identifies a valid requestId in the requestDetails mapping.
2. The actor calls the increaseFees function, specifying the requestId and arbitrary fee values (additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee).
3. The actor sends ETH equal to the sum of the additional fees.
4. The function updates the requestFee, resultFee, and batchFee for the specified requestId without requiring authorization from the owner.
5. The FeesIncreased event is emitted, reflecting the unauthorized fee increase.

### Impact

- The contract owner suffers a financial impact as unauthorized fee increases can disrupt the intended fee structure and potentially lead to financial losses.
- The protocol's integrity is compromised, as fee adjustments are no longer restricted to the owner, undermining trust in the system.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the onlyOwner modifier to the increaseFees function to restrict access to the contract owner. The updated function should look like this:
```javascript
function increaseFees(
    bytes32 requestId,
    uint256 additionalRequestFee,
    uint256 additionalResultFee,
    uint256 additionalBatchFee
) external payable override(ISedaCore) whenNotPaused onlyOwner {
    // Validate ETH payment matches fee sum to prevent over/underpayment
    if (msg.value != additionalRequestFee + additionalResultFee + additionalBatchFee) {
        revert InvalidFeeAmount();
    }

    RequestDetails storage details = _storageV1().requestDetails[requestId];
    if (details.timestamp == 0) {
        revert RequestNotFound(requestId);
    }

    details.requestFee += additionalRequestFee;
    details.resultFee += additionalResultFee;
    details.batchFee += additionalBatchFee;

    emit FeesIncreased(requestId, additionalRequestFee, additionalResultFee, additionalBatchFee);
}
```
