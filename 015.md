# A malicious peer can trigger a panic in a syncing node during blocksync.

### Summary

The system is running a vulnerable version of CometBFT, which an attacker could exploit to trigger a panic during blocksync.

In go.mod, the CometBFT version is pinned to v0.38.17. 

```solidity
github.com/cometbft/cometbft v0.38.17	
```

This version is vulnerable to [GO-2024-2951.](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2951) More details about the vulnerability are available [here.](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/security/advisories/GHSA-hg58-rf2h-6rr7)

The vulnerability allows an attacker to DoS the network by causing panics in all nodes during blocksync.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability itself is in CometBFT, but the following call in Seda call into vulnerable code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/main.go#L16

```solidity
func main() {
	rootCmd := cmd.NewRootCmd()
	if err := svrcmd.Execute(rootCmd, "", app.DefaultNodeHome); err != nil {
        // @audit - calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync()
		log.NewLogger(rootCmd.OutOrStderr()).Error("failure when running app", "err", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

```solidity
   #1: cmd/sedad/main.go:16: sedad.main calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync.BlockPool.OnStart
   #2: cmd/sedad/main.go:16: sedad.main calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync.NewReactor
   #3: cmd/sedad/main.go:16: sedad.main calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync.Reactor.OnStart
   #4: cmd/sedad/main.go:16: sedad.main calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync.Reactor.Receive
   #5: cmd/sedad/main.go:16: sedad.main calls cmd.Execute, which eventually calls blocksync.Reactor.SwitchToBlockSync
```
