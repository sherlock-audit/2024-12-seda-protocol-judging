### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L239-L242

User can withdraw timed out request but user can call `postResult` about old request.
If user calls `withdrawTimedOutRequest` by front-running - `postResult`, request is proven but `batchSender` and `submitter` can't receive reward.

### Root Cause

`withdrawTimedOutRequest` doesn't check it is already proven.

### Internal Pre-conditions

2. Request must be timed out.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls `withdrawTimedOutRequest` by front-running despite it is already proven.
2. `Submitter` calls `postResult`.


### Impact

`Submitter` and `batchSender` can't claim their reward.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Prevent withdrawing old request that is already proven.
