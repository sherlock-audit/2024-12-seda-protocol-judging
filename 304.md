# Ability to clog up the protocol using the `SedaCoreV1:postRequest()` function

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L91

The `postRequest()` function requires users to input three fees, requestFee, resultFee and batchFee. These fees act as payments and incentives for other users of the protocol to maintain security and process requests
There is a check at the start of the function that ensures `msg.value` is exactly the sum of these three fees. 

### Root Cause

No minimum fee values

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

User calls postRequest() with all three fee values set to 0

### Impact

However if a user submits a request with these three fees set to 0 and includes a `msg.value` of 0, the request will still succeed. This request will then never be actioned due to it not being worthwhile to anyone to action due to the lack of fees attached.
A malicious user could continuously submit 0 fee requests that would in turn clog up the system for these other users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a minimum fee a user who sends a `postRequest()` must include. This will ensure every request is actioned and not left in the system unactioned.
