# Front-Running `postResult` in SedaCoreV1 Leads to Loss of Funds for Relayers

## Summary:

A front-runner can exploit the `postResult` function by submitting a result with the relayer's inputs before the relayer, stealing the result fee and causing the relayer's transaction to revert. This effectively eliminates the relayer's incentive to participate, impacting the protocol's functionality and potentially causing significant financial loss to relayers.

## Vulnerability Details:

The `postResult` function in `SedaCoreV1` allows anyone to submit a result along with a Merkle proof. Relayers are intended to use this function to fulfill requests and receive the `resultFee` as compensation. However, a malicious actor (front-runner) can monitor for pending `requests` to be fulfilled by the `postResult` transactions from relayers. Later, when `result` is posted by copying the relayer's inputs (result, batch height, proof), the front-runner can submit their own `postResult` transaction with a higher gas price, causing it to be included in the block first.

Once the front-runner's transaction is executed, the request is marked as fulfilled, and the `resultFee` is transferred to the front-runner. When the relayer's transaction is subsequently executed, it reverts because the request has already been fulfilled, resulting in the relayer the intended `resultFee`.

**Code Snippet:**

The following code snippet shows the [postResult](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/051b5e88a2f530792913910ebf98c50f431b1e3b/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/core/SedaCoreV1.sol#L122) function in the `SedaCoreV1` contract:

- As there is no access control mechanism, anyone can call the `postResult` function.
- The `resultFee` is transferred to the `msg.sender` (result sender/solver) without any access control.

```solidity
function postResult(
        SedaDataTypes.Result calldata result,
        uint64 batchHeight,
        bytes32[] calldata proof
@>  ) public payable override(ResultHandlerBase, IResultHandler) whenNotPaused returns (bytes32) {
        // .. other code ..

        // Result fee distribution:
        // - send all result fee to `msg.sender` (result sender/solver)
@>      if (requestDetails.resultFee > 0) {
            _transferFee(msg.sender, requestDetails.resultFee);
            emit FeeDistributed(result.drId, msg.sender, requestDetails.resultFee, ISedaCore.FeeType.RESULT);
        }

        // .. other code ..

        return resultId;
    }
```

## Impact:

This front-running vulnerability has a strong impact on the protocol and its relayers:

- **Financial Loss for Relayers:**
  - Relayers encounter a reverted transactions, leading to a denial of service.
  - They lose the intended `resultFee`, which is their primary incentive for participating in the protocol.
- **Protocol Instability:**
  - If relayers are consistently front-run, they may incur more fund loss than expected and may result continous denial of service as the transaction will always revert.
  - This can lead to a breakdown in the protocol's ability to process requests from relayers.

## Proof of Concept:

1. An user requests a orcale data using the `request` function with necessary `requestInputs`.
2. That request is now added to the pending requests list.
3. Relayers sees the pending request and tries to fulfill it by calling the `postResult` function with the `result` and `proof`.
4. A front-runner monitors the pending requests and submits a `postResult` transaction with the same `result` and `proof` before the relayer.
5. The front-runner's transaction is included in the block first, causing the request to be marked as fulfilled and the `resultFee` to be transferred to the front-runner.
6. When the relayer's transaction is executed, it reverts because the request has already been fulfilled, resulting in the relayer losing the intended `resultFee`.

## Recommended Mitigation:

Introducting a access control based solution for the `postResult` function can help mitigate the front-running vulnerability. This can be achieved by:

- Implementing a `onlyRelayer` modifier to restrict the `postResult` function to the relayer only.
- Implement a whitelist of relayers to ensure that only authorized relayers can submit results.
