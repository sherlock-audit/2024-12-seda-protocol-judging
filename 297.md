# Requesters can remove their requests in Tallying Phase before the actual tallying

### Summary

Lack of access control on when calling `seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/sudo/remove_requests.rs::remove_request_and_process_distributions` allows requesters to get back their deposited escrow amount and remove it without paying the excutors and dataProxys for there services and gasUsed. 

This can be done at a period where a request has reached tallyPhase( all replication factor commitements have been revealed), but block building has not yet started or the block is being built.

### Root Cause

- Everyone can call `sudo/remove_requests.rs::remove_request_and_process_distributions`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Request is in tally phase but has not been tallied yet.

### External Pre-conditions

- User has viewed revealed data by the executor results and decides to get his funds without paying the excutors for their used funds.

### Attack Path

- Requester sends a data request with a replication factor of 1.
- A data executor committes and reveals this request.
- The requester queries and sees the revealed data
- After revealing, the requester can sends a remove request with a blank messages array, since the result is in the `tallyPhase` but has not been tallied by the chain as the block building process has not yet started or the block is still being built. The call will be successful. 

[remove_request_and_process_distributions call: ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/sudo/remove_requests.rs#L217C12-L219C14)
```rust
                dr_id.clone(),
                //@audit  messages will be blank
                remove_request_and_process_distributions(dr_id, &messages, &mut deps, &token, &minimum_stake),
            )
```
- The request will be able to get all his escrowed funds

### Impact

Executors wont be paid the amount( `gasUsed`) during tallying and malicious requesters will be able to get free requests completed. It can also lead to do`s were a malicious individual can call this function, to burn a requestor's funds removing their request and preventing it from being tallied.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider adding access controls to `sudo/remove_requests.rs::remove_request_and_process_distributions` to be called by only a select few.
