# Executor without stake can still execute requests without stake

## Description
The execute function does not remove an executor from the staking mapping (state::STAKERS) when their stake reaches zero. This allows executors with zero stake to continue executing requests, which bypasses the security model that requires executors to have an economic commitment. The executor is only removed when they withdraw their stake:
```solodity

        // update the executor (remove if balances are zero)
        executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal -= self.amount;
@>        if executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal.is_zero() && executor.tokens_staked.is_zero() {
            state::STAKERS.remove(deps.storage, public_key)?;
        } else {
            state::STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;
        }

        // send the tokens back to the executor
        let bank_msg = BankMsg::Send {
            to_address: info.sender.to_string(),
            amount:     coins(self.amount.u128(), token),
        };
```
However even after all tokens have been unstaked the executor remains in the staked mapping of executors this allows a malicious executor to unstake his tokens and perform malicious request while still being registered.
```solidity
 fn execute(self, deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        // verify the proof
        let chain_id = CHAIN_ID.load(deps.storage)?;
        let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
        let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
        self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;

        // error if amount is greater than staked tokens
        let mut executor = state::STAKERS.get_staker(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
        if self.amount > executor.tokens_staked {
            return Err(ContractError::InsufficientFunds(executor.tokens_staked, self.amount));
        }

        // update the executor
        executor.tokens_staked -= self.amount;
        executor.tokens_pending_withdrawal += self.amount;
        state::STAKERS.update(deps.storage, public_key, &executor)?;

        // TODO: emit when pending tokens can be withdrawn

        Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("action", "unstake").add_events([
            create_executor_action_event(
                "unstake",
                self.public_key.clone(),
                info.sender.to_string(),
                self.amount,
                seq,
            ),
            create_executor_event(executor, self.public_key),
        ]))
    }
```
As no check to remove when executor has unstaked all amounts
## POC 
1. Register as a validator with the min staked amount
2. Unstake your all tokens wihout withdrawing
3. Try and execute malicious requests
4. protocol notices and tries to slash from staked amount, But notices 0 staked amount
## Impact 
Malicious executor can finalize improper requests
## Recommended Mitigation
When unstaked amount reaches 0 remove and update
