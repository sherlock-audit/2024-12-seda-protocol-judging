# Malicious proposer can submit a request with large invalid transactions because of no mempool to bloat the block store

### Summary

Context:
- Raw transaction bytes of every transaction included in a proposed block will be stored by CometBFT in its Blockstore
- There is no BlockStore pruning done by SEDA Chain

The SEDA Chain's proposal handlers are configured with a [no-op mempool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/app.go#L1012). This default ProcessProposal handler
is [called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/abci/handlers.go#L273) after the vote extensions have been verified. Since 
the handler is configured with a no-op mempool, [no additional processing](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/baseapp/abci_utils.go#L421-L427) is done and the transactions are accepted with verification.

Given the above, a malicious proposer can abuse the lack of transaction validation and fill every block they propose with invalid
transactions up to the MaxBlockSize (a consensus parameter set in CometBFT). 

### Root Cause

In [`app.go:1012`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/app/app.go#L1012), the default proposal handlers are configured to use the `NoOpMempool`. However, it is not advisable to use that in production because
of the lack of transaction verification.

```golang
defaultProposalHandler := baseapp.NewDefaultProposalHandler(mempool.NoOpMempool{}, bApp)
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
None


### External Pre-conditions
None


### Attack Path

1. A proposer proposes a block with a valid first transaction and the rest of the block filled with invalid transactions up to the MaxBlockSize.
2. This block with mostly invalid transactions will be accepted by every validator even if all the other transactions fail. The raw transaction bytes of all the transactions will be recorded in the BlockStore.


### Impact

Permanent storage of invalid transactions that would bloat the chain unnecessarily and consume more resources during:
- Block propagation (network bandwidth)
- Block processing (CPU/memory)
- Block storage (disk space)
- Future node synchronization

### PoC
None


### Mitigation
Consider replacing `NoOpMempool` with a valid mempool when configuring the proposal handlers.
