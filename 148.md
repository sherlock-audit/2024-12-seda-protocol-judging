# A validator can reuse their signature multiple times to post a batch with low voting power on Secp256k1ProverV1

### Summary

In the signature array in `postBatch`, one could simply insert a validator's signature multiple times. If the validator's proof is also repeated in `validatorProofs`, the voting power of that validator would be counted multiple times. This means a validator could post a batch using only their own signature, even if they actually have less voting power than `CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE`.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L92-L93
There is no check in `postBatch` that verifies whether `signatures` or `validatorProofs` contain the same element multiple times. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L109-L125
In this loop, it is verified that the validator proofs are correct and that the signature matches. Then, the voting power of all validators is summed up. If less voting power than the `CONSENSUS_PERCENTAGE` has voted for the batch, it is reverted. However, the loop does not check whether a validator proof appears multiple times, only whether it is valid. This allows a malicious validator to count their voting power multiple times and thus bypass consensus to post batches.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A malicious validator must be included in the validator Merkle tree. However, this shouldn't be a problem since it can get there just like any other validator.

### External Pre-conditions

No external preconditions

### Attack Path

1. An attacker joins the system as a SEDA chain validator
2. The attacker validator only participates correctly in the system for a short time so that it is included in the validator merkle tree
3. A user calls postRequest on SedaCoreV1
4. The attacker sees this, waits for one block, creates a batch, signs it, and calls `postBatch` on `Secp256k1Prover.sol`, while repeating their own signature.
5. Since the attacker can define the `resultsRoot` in the batch himself, he can now publish it using `postResult` on `SedaCoreV1` and thus return incorrect data for the request.

### Impact

An attacker can post incorrect results, which could cause the protocol that uses this data to potentially malfunction or become vulnerable to attacks, for example, if the Seda oracle is used as a price feed. Additionally, an attacker could submit a false `validatorsRoot`, preventing new batches from being posted, as the `validatorsRoot` of the contract and the seda chain would no longer be in sync. This would render the entire system unusable.

### PoC

The test can be inserted into the following file: `test/prover/Secp256k1ProverV1.test.ts`
```javascript
  it('audit-test', async () => {
    const { prover, wallets, data } = await loadFixture(deployProverFixture);

    const { newBatch, signatures } = await generateAndSignBatch(wallets, data.initialBatch, [0, 1]);
    //The setup works in such a way that the first validator has 75% of the voting power, and the remaining 25% is split among the other three validators. 
    //This means that the last three validators each have just over 8% voting power. This call to postBatch clearly shows that a validator with 8% voting power 
    //can post a batch on their own.
    await prover.postBatch(newBatch, [
      signatures[1], signatures[1], signatures[1], 
      signatures[1], signatures[1], signatures[1],
      signatures[1], signatures[1], signatures[1]
    ], [
      data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1],
      data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1],
      data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1], data.validatorProofs[1]
    ]);
  });
```
The test can then be run with `bun run test`.
