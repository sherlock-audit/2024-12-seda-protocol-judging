# No Request Cleanup Mechanism in `RequestHandlerBase.sol`

### Summary

In the RequestHandlerBase.sol contract, requests are stored indefinitely in requests mapping with no expiration or removal logic, leading to potential storage bloat. Making it a high impact as it Increases gas costs over time.

### Root Cause

The choice not to delete added requests to the contract leads to an infinite number of requests in the contract, eventually making it unusable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

there is no Internal Pre-conditions


### External Pre-conditions

there is no external conditions 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker makes an infinite number of requests.
2. The number of requests will be increased over time.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from a high cost of gas over time or when an attacker makes a DOS attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Integrate with SedaCoreV1.solâ€™s cleanup (e.g., call delete in postResult) or add an expiration timestamp.
