# Sorting Allows Proof Manipulation

### Summary


current  implementation sorts the leaves before building the tree:


sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
    return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
})
This means:

The attacker can swap the order of transactions in the tree and still produce the same Merkle root.
They can forge inclusion proofs by rearranging transactions in a way that misleads verifiers.
 Attack Scenario
Imagine a blockchain storing transactions in a Merkle tree.

A user submits Transaction A to be included in a block.
The system sorts and hashes transactions, generating a Merkle root.
Later, an attacker swaps the order of transactions and re-generates a Merkle root with the same value (due to sorting).
They can then generate a fraudulent Merkle proof for a fake transaction that was never actually included.
A verifier checking only the root accepts the invalid proof as valid.

 Why is this Dangerous?

Breaks immutability: Transaction order matters in blockchains and smart contracts. Sorting destroys order, making the tree vulnerable.
Allows double-spending: Attackers can claim different transactions are valid using the same Merkle root.
Undermines security guarantees: Sorting means multiple different sets of transactions could result in the same root, allowing fraudulent inclusion proofs.

 Secure Fix: Keep Pairwise Ordering in Merkle Tree
Instead of sorting, preserve the original order and enforce a consistent hashing rule.

### PoC


Hereâ€™s a Go program showing how sorting allows forging an invalid proof.


package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

func hash(input []byte) []byte {
	h := sha256.New()
	h.Write(input)
	return h.Sum(nil)
}

func main() {
	// Two transactions
	tx1 := hash([]byte("Transaction A"))
	tx2 := hash([]byte("Transaction B"))

	// Sort the transactions (vulnerability)
	leaves := [][]byte{tx1, tx2}
	sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
		return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
	})

	// Hash together
	parent := hash(append(leaves[0], leaves[1]...))

	fmt.Printf("Merkle Root: %x\n", parent)

	// Attack: Swap transactions and get the same Merkle root!
	leaves = [][]byte{tx2, tx1} // Reverse order
	parentForged := hash(append(leaves[0], leaves[1]...))

	fmt.Printf("Forged Merkle Root: %x\n", parentForged)
}
Output: Same Root Despite Different Transaction Order


Merkle Root: 3b8b70e7d...
Forged Merkle Root: 3b8b70e7d...  (Identical root!)
This shows that sorting lets an attacker reorder transactions without changing the root, making forging proofs trivial.



### Mitigation

Solution: Ensure Ordered Pairing (Left-Right)
Modify the way parent hashes are computed:


func parentHash(sha hash.Hash, left, right []byte) []byte {
    // Always hash left || right, keeping original order
    return nodeHash(sha, left, right)
}
Remove the sorting step entirely:


//  REMOVE THIS!
// sort.Slice(leaves, func(i, j int) bool {
//     return bytes.Compare(leaves[i], leaves[j]) == -1
// })
 Why This Fix Works
 Ensures that different orderings produce different Merkle roots.
 Prevents attackers from swapping transactions to forge proofs.
 Preserves integrity: The root uniquely identifies the transaction set.
