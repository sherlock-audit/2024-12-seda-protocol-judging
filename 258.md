# It's possible to slash anybody as the evidence logic does not check for the batchID block number

### Summary

The current implementation allows to slash anybody just by providing the different batchID than the one from the current block.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the fact that it's not checked whether the fraudulent batchID relates to the same block or to another and if any different batchID is provided to the function, the validator gets slashed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

-

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

An incorrect evidence for double signing is submitted against the validator.

### Impact

Validator gets unfairly slashed.

### PoC

Let's take a look at the implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/x/batching/keeper/evidence.go#L38-64
```go
	// Validate the signed batch is different from what was recorded on chain.
	fraudulentBatchID, err := evidence.GetBatchID()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	if bytes.Equal(batch.BatchId, fraudulentBatchID) {
		return fmt.Errorf("batch IDs are the same")
	}

	// Currently we only support secp256k1 signatures so no need to check which proving scheme the validator used.
	signatureAddr, err := k.recoverEthAddressFromSecp256k1Signature(fraudulentBatchID, evidence.Signature)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// Retrieve the validator entry from the previous batch, as they might have changed their public key in the
	// fraudulent batch.
	validatorEthAddr, err := k.getEthAddressForBatch(ctx, evidence.BatchNumber-1, evidence.OperatorAddress)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	// If the recovered address matches the validator entry they have committed a double sign.
	if !bytes.Equal(validatorEthAddr, signatureAddr) {
		return fmt.Errorf("recovered address does not match validator entry. Recorded: %s, Got: %s", hex.EncodeToString(validatorEthAddr), hex.EncodeToString(signatureAddr))
	}

```

As you can see here, the function just compares if the `fraudulentBatchID` provided from the evidence and the one from the batch are equal. If they're any different then validator gets slashed. This opens up an attack vector where any malicious user can virtually provide just different batchIDs and the function will slash the validator.

### Mitigation

Consider checking if the `fraudulentBatchID` relates to the same block.
