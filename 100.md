# Missing configDirC Memory Deallocation Leads to Memory Leak and Affects Multiple Calls

### Summary

In the `ExecuteTallyVm` function, `configDirC` allocated via `C.CString(LogDir)` is never freed. When the function is called repeatedly, the memory allocated for `configDirC` will leak with each call, causing memory usage to steadily grow until it may eventually crash the process. This presents a serious stability and availability risk for any protocol or application that relies on this function, as high-frequency invocations can rapidly consume available memory resources.

### Root Cause

Within `tallyvm.go`, `configDirC` is allocated with `C.CString(LogDir)` but is never explicitly freed. This memory allocation is not released by `free_ffi_vm_result`, so it accumulates on every call, leading to a persistent leak.

[View source](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/tallyvm/execute.go#L27)

```go
func ExecuteTallyVm(bytes []byte, args []string, envs map[string]string) VmResult {
    // convert config dir to C string
    configDirC := C.CString(LogDir) // <---------

    ...
    result := C.execute_tally_vm(
        configDirC,
        bytesPtr, C.uintptr_t(len(bytes)),
        argsPtr, C.uintptr_t(len(args)),
        keysPtr, valuesPtr, C.uintptr_t(len(envs)),
    )
    exitMessage := C.GoString(result.exit_info.exit_message)
    exitCode := int(result.exit_info.exit_code)

    defer C.free_ffi_vm_result(&result) // <--------
    
    ...
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Simply calling `ExecuteTallyVm` repeatedly or in a high-frequency environment, even during normal operations, causes the unreleased `configDirC` allocations to remain on the heap.
2. Memory usage grows over time without any automatic recovery.
3. This eventually risks depleting all available memory, potentially causing the process or system to crash.

### Impact

- Affected Parties: Any application or service invoking `ExecuteTallyVm`.
- Can lead to severe performance degradation, memory exhaustion, or process crashes, effectively constituting a denial of service (DoS).
- No special attacker action is required beyond forcing repeated calls to the vulnerable function, after which the memory consumption will lead to resource exhaustion.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Just like how `keys`, `values`, and `bytes` are freed in the code: [codelink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-wasm-vm/tallyvm/execute.go#L41)
You must also free the memory allocated by `C.CString(LogDir)` in the `ExecuteTallyVm` function. Specifically, after calling `C.CString(LogDir)`, make sure to use:

```go
configDirC := C.CString(LogDir)
...
defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(configDirC))
```

to properly release the allocated memory.
