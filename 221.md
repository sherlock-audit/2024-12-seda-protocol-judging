# The return value of `is_staker_allowed()` isn't checked in `stake.execute()`

### Summary

The return value of `is_staker_allowed()` isn't checked in `stake.execute()`, this will allow signers who aren't on the allowlist to be able to call the execute function even tho the allowlist is on.

```rust
pub fn is_staker_allowed(deps: &DepsMut, public_key: &PublicKey) -> Result<(), ContractError> {
    let allowlist_enabled = STAKING_CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?.allowlist_enabled;
    if allowlist_enabled {
        let is_allowed = ALLOWLIST.may_load(deps.storage, public_key)?;
        if is_allowed.is_none() {
            return Err(ContractError::NotOnAllowlist);
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

```

```rust
   fn execute(self, deps: DepsMut, env: Env, info: MessageInfo) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
        // verify the proof
        let chain_id = CHAIN_ID.load(deps.storage)?;
        let public_key = PublicKey::from_hex_str(&self.public_key)?;
        let seq = inc_get_seq(deps.storage, &public_key)?;
        self.verify(public_key.as_ref(), &chain_id, env.contract.address.as_str(), seq)?;

        // if allowlist is on, check if the signer is in the allowlist
        is_staker_allowed(&deps, &public_key)?;//@audit-issue return value isn't checked and code isn't made to exit in is_staker_allowed(). MIT. add `std::process::exit(1);` to the error side`

```

### Root Cause

The return value of `is_staker_allowed()` isn't checked in `stake.execute()`, this will allow signers who aren't on the allowlist to be able to call the execute function even tho the allowlist is on.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `stake.execute()` doesn't check the return value of `is_staker_allowed()`

### External Pre-conditions

User who isn't on ALLOWLIST wants to successfully call  `stake.execute()`

### Attack Path

signer who isn't on ALLOWLIST calls `stake.execute()` successfully.

### Impact

The return value of `is_staker_allowed()` isn't checked in `stake.execute()`, this will allow signers who aren't on the allowlist to be able to call the execute function even tho the allowlist is on.

Access control issues

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check the return value of `is_staker_allowed()`
