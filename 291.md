# Checks If replication Factor is less than or Equal misses something, allowing posting of requests which can not be Completed

.

### Summary

When posting requests, the contracts check if the replication factor requested by the requestor does not go beyond the available `STAKERS` count, this is to ensure that there are enough executors who can complete the user's request.

[The check for Replication Factor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain-contracts/contract/src/msgs/data_requests/execute/post_request.rs#L16C9-L19C10)

```rust
        let stakers_length = STAKERS.len(deps.storage)?;
        if self.posted_dr.replication_factor as u32 > stakers_length {
            return Err(ContractError::DataRequestReplicationFactorTooHigh(stakers_length));
        }
```

The issue is that the `STAKERS` count also includes unstaking staker with pending withdrawals whose staking amount is less than the minimum required to complete a request.

This leads to posting of requests which can never be completed, hence a loss of funds to the requester paid to commiter yet fails to get a final data result.

### Root Cause

- Checking `STAKERS` count instead of eligible staker to committe

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Less eligible stakers then the available `STAKERS` count.

### External Pre-conditions

- User wants a replication factor less than `STAKERS` count but more than eligible stakers to commit.

### Attack Path

- Requestors posts a request with replication factor of 10, the available `STAKERS` count is 12 but of those 4 are unstaking leaving only 8 stakers eligible to commit.
- The 8 commit their results and since they are less than the replication factor, the request will expire without revealing phase being reached. The requester will pay for these commits but will not be able to get his results.

### Impact

Requestor losses funds by not getting the intended results but pays committers.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider checking eligible stakers to commit instead of `STAKERS` count
