# Application and Tendermint Unsafe Setting Exposes Nodes to Unauthorized Cross-Origin Requests

### Summary

The use of EnableUnsafeCORS set to true in the custom app configuration will cause unrestricted cross-origin requests for production nodes, as attackers will be able to access API endpoints from arbitrary origins.

### Root Cause

The choice to [enable unsafe CORS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-12-seda-protocol/blob/main/seda-chain/cmd/sedad/cmd/config_defaults.go#L69) in the app configuration is a mistake as it leaves API endpoints unprotected. The API is set with EnableUnsafeCORS = true, which is acceptable for testing but risky in production.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The node operator does not override the default setting in production deployments.  
2. The application’s configuration file retains EnableUnsafeCORS set to true.

### External Pre-conditions

1. An attacker can initiate cross-origin HTTP requests from an untrusted domain.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker crafts a cross-origin request to a sensitive API endpoint.  
2. Due to the unsafe CORS setting, the node responds to the request without validating the origin.  
3. The attacker gains unauthorized access to potentially sensitive node data or functionality.

### Impact

The production node’s API may leak sensitive information or allow unauthorized manipulation, compromising the node’s security posture.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that production deployments override the unsafe CORS setting with stricter policies that only allow requests from trusted origins.
